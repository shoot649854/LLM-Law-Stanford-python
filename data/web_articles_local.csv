If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website. 
If you are interested in changing to F or M Student Status, see the Changing to a Nonimmigrant F or M Student Status page.

F-1 Student Visa | San Jose Immigration Lawyer ...,"The F-1 visa is available to the foreign nationals who are coming to the U.S. as an international student. There are only certain schools in the United States, who are certified and authorized by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to accept international students. The current list of certified SEVP school list can be downloaded at Study in The States.
To qualify for student visa, foreign national must first obtain enrollment at SEVP certified school. Upon enrollment, the school will issue a Form I-20 to the applicant. Once the foreign national receives Form I-20, he/she is required to pay mandatory SEVP fees to the Immigration and Custom Enforcement. Please note that this fee must be paid before his/her visa interview at the U.S. Consulate or Embassy. Further, student visa is available to foreign national applicants who can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the U.S. Consulate that they have sufficient funds to pay the tuition fees and maintain themselves during the course of their study in the United States. Further, applicant will have to convince the consular officer that he/she will return to their country of origin at the expiration of the F-1 stay in the United States. If the consular officer will find any information/document missing, the student visa application will be put on hold until requisite information is submitted. In certain situations, this could very well result in foreign national not being able to join the school on time in the United States.
The F-1 visa holder’s spouse and unmarried children, who are under twenty-one (21) years of age are eligible for the F-2 dependent visa and may stay in the U.S as long as F-1 visa holder maintains his/her immigration status in the U.S. The spouse of the F-1 visa holder is not authorized to work in the U.S.
The validity of F-1 student status is valid for the duration of foreign nationals study in the United States.
F-1 student is eligible for temporary employment (optional practical training) in the United States that is related to his/her major area of study. He may be authorized to receive pre and post optional practical training (OPT). However the student must refrain from any unauthorized employment during the time period he/she maintains legal status in the U.S.

President Obama’s remarks about post-study work options for foreign students in the context of Immigration Reform:
Right now, there are brilliant students from all over the world sitting in classrooms at our top universities. They’re earning degrees in the fields of the future, like engineering and computer science. But once they finish school, once they earn that diploma, there’s a good chance they’ll have to leave our country. Think about that.
Intel was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here. Instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here. Right now in one of those classrooms, there’s a student wrestling with how to turn their big idea — their Intel or Instagram — into a big business. We’re giving them all the skills they need to figure that out, but then we’re going to turn around and tell them to start that business and create those jobs in China or India or Mexico or someplace else? That’s not how you grow new industries in America. That’s how you give new industries to our competitors. That’s why we need comprehensive immigration reform.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

There is no guarantee you will be issued a visa. Do not make final travel plans or buy tickets until you have a visa.
For information about working in the United States during your study, review Students and Employment and Form I-765 Work Authorization Instructions on the USCIS website.
If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

F-1 Visas | San Diego Immigration Lawyers Law Offices of ...,"Immigration Quiz
An alien, who is on a visitor visa and wants to take a short course of study of less than 18 hours per week, may be able to do so. However, if the course of study is more than 18 hours a week, he/she will need a student visa. F-1 visa is for non-immigrants wishing to pursue academic studies and/or language training programs. In most countries, first time student visa applicants are required to appear for an in-person interview. However, each embassy and consulate sets its own interview policies and procedures regarding student visas.
One should keep in mind that June, July, and August are the busiest months in most consular sections, and interview appointments are the most difficult to get during that period. Therefore, students need to plan ahead to avoid having to make repeat visits to the Embassy.
For qualifying, an alien must meet the following requirements:
An interview at the embassy consular section is required for visa applicants from age 14 through 79. The waiting time for an interview appointment for applicants can vary. It is important to remember that applying early and providing the requested documents does not guarantee that the student will receive a visa. Generally, all applicants for a student visa must provide:
The dependents should provide:
A visa allows a foreign citizen coming from abroad, to travel to the United States port-of entry and request permission to enter the U.S. Applicants should be aware that a visa does not guarantee entry into the United States. The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States. If you are allowed to enter the U.S., the CBP official will determine the length of your visit on the Arrival-Departure Record (Form I-94). Since Form I-94 documents your authorized stay in the U.S., it's very important to keep in your passport. Student visitors must have their Form I-20 in their possession each time they enter the United States.
Students are admitted for the duration of status which is necessary to complete a full course of study, a period of authorized practical training following the course of study, plus a 60 day grace period.

USCIS Updates Policy Guidance for International Students,"Official websites use .gov

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is issuing policy guidance regarding the F and M student nonimmigrant classifications, including the agency’s role in adjudicating applications for employment authorization, change of status, extension of stay, and reinstatement of status for these students and their dependents in the United States.
This guidance consolidates existing policy. USCIS expects that this will provide welcome clarity to international students and U.S. educational institutions on a wealth of topics, including eligibility requirements, school transfers, practical training, and on- and off-campus employment.
For example, the guidance clarifies that F and M students must have a foreign residence that they do not intend to abandon, but that such students may be the beneficiary of a permanent labor certification application or immigrant visa petition and may still be able to demonstrate their intention to depart after a temporary period of stay.
In addition, the guidance specifies how F students seeking an extension of optional practical training (OPT) based on their degree in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field may be employed by startup companies, as long as the employer adheres to the training plan requirements, remains in good standing with E-Verify, and provides compensation commensurate to that provided to similarly situated U.S. workers, among other requirements.
The nonimmigrant academic student (F-1) classification allows a noncitizen to enter the United States as a full-time student at a college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution, or in a language training program. The nonimmigrant vocational student (M-1) classification includes students in established vocational or other recognized nonacademic programs, other than language training programs.
For more information about the USCIS guidance, see the Policy Alert (PDF, 312.06 KB) and Volume 2, Part F of the Policy Manual. For more information about the role of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in administering these nonimmigrant student programs, see the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS).

"The F-1 Student Visa, Explained","Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
What is the F-1 visa?
The F-1 visa allows a student to temporarily live in the United States for a defined period of time while studying at a school, college, seminary, or conservatory.
Is the F-1 visa right for me?
For many students, the chance to study in the United States is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. Unless the person is already a U.S. citizen or green card holder, all prospective students will have to apply for a visa to study in the United States.
Because there are so many courses and places to study in the United States, the F-1 visa has a pretty broad application but also some very clear rules. The first is that you have to be coming to the United States with the intent to temporarily study. In other words, this is not an immigrant visa.
You must be studying at an academic institution, not training at a vocational school, as this will require an M-1 visa. Your academic institution must be approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning it needs to be accredited to be able to accept foreign students on F-1 visas.
You will be able to work, but because this is a non-immigrant visa, you will be restricted to where you can work and the type of work. Finally, although your spouse and children can come with you, they will not be able to work but your children can enroll in schools. They will be on F-2 visas and tied to your visa’s status.
Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have. Learn more about what we do to help.
The requirements for an F-1 visa are:
For many students, the process of applying and being accepted into a U.S. academic institution is the lengthiest part. The visa process is a series of steps that take place after you accept an enrollment offer. Not sure if you qualify for an F-1 student visa? Start by checking your eligibility.
Congratulations, you have been accepted into a course of study by a U.S. academic institution! Years of hard work probably led you to this milestone, so here’s the process to obtain your student visa.
After your SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be added to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVP uses SEVIS to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M, and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.
Once you have registered with SEVIS, you will need to pay the I-901 fee. This fee is currently $350 for most people, and funds the SEVP program.
Your SEVP-approved school will then issue you a Form I-20. This form is incredibly important as it confirms your acceptance at the school, and therefore your eligibility for the F-1 visa. Once this Form I-20 has been issued, you will be able to apply to a U.S. embassy or consulate for your F-1 visa.
The steps required will vary between different U.S. embassies or consulates, so make sure you check their websites for further information.
However, you must complete the Form DS-160, which is similar to the Form DS-260 for immigrant visas. The form is very detailed and can take some time to fill in, so make sure you set aside plenty of time to complete it.
Once you have completed the Form DS-160, you will need to schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, unless you are under 13 years of age or over 80 years of age. The U.S. Department of State says you should schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country where you live. You may schedule your interview at another U.S. embassy or consulate, but be aware that it may be more difficult to qualify for a visa outside of the country where you live.
Prior to your interview, you will need to pay the $185 application fee and also, depending on your nationality, pay an issuance fee, as well. The visa issuance fee is only due after your interview, if your visa is approved. The next step will be an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate.
Visa wait times can vary depending on the time of year and location. You can use the appointment wait time tool to see how long you will have to wait for an appointment at a specific U.S. embassy or consulate.
At this stage, it is important to note that F-1 visas for new students can only be issued up to 365 days (one year) in advance of the start date for a course of study. It used to be 120 days, but in February, 2023, the State Department extended the period.
Note: For existing F-1 visas, this is not the case and visas can be issued any time, as long as the student is currently enrolled at a SEVP-approved school or institution and in SEVIS.
Boundless not only makes it easy for you to complete your F-1 student visa application, but we can also help you get ready for your visa interview. Learn more about what you get with Boundless.
You will generally be required to attend an interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate. You will need to bring:
You should also be prepared to bring evidence of:
During your interview, the consular officer will ask you questions to determine whether or not to approve your F-1 visa. Make sure you are complete and accurate in your answers, as you will be under oath. For interview tips, see the Boundless guide on preparing for the F-1 student visa interview.
The consular officer will also take your fingerprints, although this will vary depending on your location. After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing. The consular officer will let you know if this is required.
Once your interview is complete, you will be informed of the outcome and, if successful, be issued a visa to study in the United States.

Yes, you can bring your spouse and children with you. Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
F-1 students cannot work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students can engage in three types of off-campus employment:
This depends on your individual taxation situation, but typically you might be required to file a U.S. tax return. For more information, seek advice from a qualified tax professional.
Generally, an F-1 student may transfer between SEVP-certified schools. However, this does involve paperwork and coordination. See here for more detailed instructions.
There are some programs and visas available for F-1 visa holders after you finish studying in the United States. These can be highly individual to your circumstances, field of study, and professional background, so do your research carefully.

You don’t have to navigate the F-1 student visa process alone. Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have along the way. Learn more about what we do to help.
