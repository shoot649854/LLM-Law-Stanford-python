Student Visa


Exchange Visitor Visa


Generally, a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

To enter the United States to attend:
You need the following visa category:
University or college

High School
Private elementary school
Seminary
Conservatory
Another academic institution, including a language training program
Vocational or other recognized nonacademic institution, other than a language training program
M


Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.

"The F-1 Student Visa, Explained","Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
What is the F-1 visa?
The F-1 visa allows a student to temporarily live in the United States for a defined period of time while studying at a school, college, seminary, or conservatory.
Is the F-1 visa right for me?
For many students, the chance to study in the United States is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. Unless the person is already a U.S. citizen or green card holder, all prospective students will have to apply for a visa to study in the United States.
Because there are so many courses and places to study in the United States, the F-1 visa has a pretty broad application but also some very clear rules. The first is that you have to be coming to the United States with the intent to temporarily study. In other words, this is not an immigrant visa.
You must be studying at an academic institution, not training at a vocational school, as this will require an M-1 visa. Your academic institution must be approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning it needs to be accredited to be able to accept foreign students on F-1 visas.
You will be able to work, but because this is a non-immigrant visa, you will be restricted to where you can work and the type of work. Finally, although your spouse and children can come with you, they will not be able to work but your children can enroll in schools. They will be on F-2 visas and tied to your visa’s status.
Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have. Learn more about what we do to help.
The requirements for an F-1 visa are:
For many students, the process of applying and being accepted into a U.S. academic institution is the lengthiest part. The visa process is a series of steps that take place after you accept an enrollment offer. Not sure if you qualify for an F-1 student visa? Start by checking your eligibility.
Congratulations, you have been accepted into a course of study by a U.S. academic institution! Years of hard work probably led you to this milestone, so here’s the process to obtain your student visa.
After your SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be added to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVP uses SEVIS to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M, and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.
Once you have registered with SEVIS, you will need to pay the I-901 fee. This fee is currently $350 for most people, and funds the SEVP program.
Your SEVP-approved school will then issue you a Form I-20. This form is incredibly important as it confirms your acceptance at the school, and therefore your eligibility for the F-1 visa. Once this Form I-20 has been issued, you will be able to apply to a U.S. embassy or consulate for your F-1 visa.
The steps required will vary between different U.S. embassies or consulates, so make sure you check their websites for further information.
However, you must complete the Form DS-160, which is similar to the Form DS-260 for immigrant visas. The form is very detailed and can take some time to fill in, so make sure you set aside plenty of time to complete it.
Once you have completed the Form DS-160, you will need to schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, unless you are under 13 years of age or over 80 years of age. The U.S. Department of State says you should schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country where you live. You may schedule your interview at another U.S. embassy or consulate, but be aware that it may be more difficult to qualify for a visa outside of the country where you live.
Prior to your interview, you will need to pay the $185 application fee and also, depending on your nationality, pay an issuance fee, as well. The visa issuance fee is only due after your interview, if your visa is approved. The next step will be an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate.
Visa wait times can vary depending on the time of year and location. You can use the appointment wait time tool to see how long you will have to wait for an appointment at a specific U.S. embassy or consulate.
At this stage, it is important to note that F-1 visas for new students can only be issued up to 365 days (one year) in advance of the start date for a course of study. It used to be 120 days, but in February, 2023, the State Department extended the period.
Note: For existing F-1 visas, this is not the case and visas can be issued any time, as long as the student is currently enrolled at a SEVP-approved school or institution and in SEVIS.
Boundless not only makes it easy for you to complete your F-1 student visa application, but we can also help you get ready for your visa interview. Learn more about what you get with Boundless.
You will generally be required to attend an interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate. You will need to bring:
You should also be prepared to bring evidence of:
During your interview, the consular officer will ask you questions to determine whether or not to approve your F-1 visa. Make sure you are complete and accurate in your answers, as you will be under oath. For interview tips, see the Boundless guide on preparing for the F-1 student visa interview.
The consular officer will also take your fingerprints, although this will vary depending on your location. After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing. The consular officer will let you know if this is required.
Once your interview is complete, you will be informed of the outcome and, if successful, be issued a visa to study in the United States.

Yes, you can bring your spouse and children with you. Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
F-1 students cannot work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students can engage in three types of off-campus employment:
This depends on your individual taxation situation, but typically you might be required to file a U.S. tax return. For more information, seek advice from a qualified tax professional.
Generally, an F-1 student may transfer between SEVP-certified schools. However, this does involve paperwork and coordination. See here for more detailed instructions.
There are some programs and visas available for F-1 visa holders after you finish studying in the United States. These can be highly individual to your circumstances, field of study, and professional background, so do your research carefully.

You don’t have to navigate the F-1 student visa process alone. Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have along the way. Learn more about what we do to help.

Apply For Your U.S. Student Visa: Undergraduate,"
Jump to navigation

The United States government offers three student visa types including F, J, and M.
Before you can apply for an F, J, or M student visa, you must first apply and be accepted by a U.S. institution of higher education that is certified by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP).
Even when an institution is SEVP-certified and able to issue I-20 and DS-2019 forms for use in visa applications, it may not hold national or regional accreditation. The U.S. Department of Education and Council for Higher Education Accreditation databases list accreditation status for all U.S. institutions. Institutions designated by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to place participants in Academic Exchange programs (J visas) must be accredited. Recognition of course credits and degrees by other institutions and by U.S. and international employers is linked to an institution's accreditation. To learn more about accreditation talk to an EducationUSA Adviser in person or online.
Once accepted at an SEVP-certified school, you will receive a Form I-20 or DS-2019 from the institution's international student office to present when you apply for your student visa. Once you receive your form, visit:
1. U.S. Department of State - Consular Affairs (Student Visas)
2. U.S. Department of State - U.S. Embassies and Consulates
3. U.S. Department of Homeland Security - Study in the States
It is important to note that two separate U.S. government agencies are involved with international student arrival and status while studying in the United States. The State Department is responsible for the visa application process and issuing the visa. Once a visa holder arrives in the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then takes over as the responsible agency for entry into the country, as well as issuing and enforcing international student regulations. Please read information from all three sources above before applying for a U.S. student visa. The sites address employment, maintaining your status, and other vital topics.

"F-1 Visas for International Students: Requirements, Rules ...","Get ready to study abroad in America with our step-by-step guide to F-1 visa rules. 
Students wishing to study in the United States need to learn about the F-1 student visa application process. There are more than one million international students currently studying abroad in the USA, and with some preparation and guidance, you can join them. To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. The I-20 form provided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with your F-1 visa after graduation.
Have questions about the student visa process? Attend an upcoming Shorelight webinar > 
There are several F-1 visa rules to keep in mind if you plan to apply for a F-1 student visa. You must meet these requirements for your application to be accepted:
Institution certification—The college or the university where you plan to study needs to be approved by SEVP Immigration & Customs Enforcement.
Full-time enrollment—You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution while your academic term is in session.
English language proficiency—You must meet the required English language proficiency score of the institution you are attending or be enrolled in courses that will help you improve your English proficiency.
Sufficient funding—You must prove you have sufficient funds available to finance your studies and living expenses while in the US.
Valid passport—Your passport should be valid for US travel for at least six months after your program completion date.
Home country residency—You are required to have a residence in your home country to return to following the completion of your degree.

Before you begin your F-1 visa application, you must take the following steps:
Get accepted by a SEVP-certified institution before submitting your visa application. When you are accepted, you will receive your I-20 form, which you will need to apply for your F-1 visa.
Pay your SEVIS fee.
Complete your DS-160 visa application.
Schedule your visa interview.
Attend your visa interview.
If you are applying for a F-1 visa from India, Shorelight’s F-1 visa for Indian students guide is for you.
Once these steps are completed, you will be ready to complete and submit your F-1 student visa application. 
1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US government’s way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education. 
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay. 
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials. 
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., like getting a US driver’s license). 
Helpful resources: Confirm your US university is a SEVP-accredited institution 
Keep your Shorelight enrollment advisor updated through every step of the visa process – when you submit your application, schedule your visa interview, and, of course, when your visa application is approved.
2. Pay Your SEVIS Fee
The total cost for your F-1 student visa will be approximately $510, which includes the cost of the visa itself, plus SEVIS processing and maintenance fees. 
Requirements: Your I-20
Cost: $350 
Where to apply: Payment portal for your SEVIS fee
Make sure to save the I-901 SEVIS fee receipt. You will need it for your visa interview. 
3. Complete Your DS-160 Visa Application
Your DS-160 is your visa application. All prospective international students must complete a DS-160 to receive an F-1 visa. 
Requirements: Your I-20, passport, travel itinerary, photo for your visa
Cost: $160 
Where to apply: Application portal for your DS-160
After you successfully submit your DS-160, you will receive a printed confirmation with a barcode on it. Save this form – you will need it for your visa interview. 
4. Schedule Your Visa Interview
Find the nearest US embassy or consulate and schedule your visa interview. Wait times will vary by country and can take months — so remember to set up your appointments as early as possible!
If you are enrolling at a US university through Shorelight, ask your enrollment advisor about student visa interview tips or how to set up a mock interview session. Practicing your visa interview in advance will make you feel more comfortable with the process.
Ask your Shorelight advisor to set up a mock visa interview for you.
5. Attend Your Visa Interview
During the interview portion of the F-1 visa application process, the US consulate or embassy confirms you are coming to study as a legitimate, serious student. In your visa interview, you must also prove you have the funds to cover your time studying in the US, and confirm that you plan on returning home after your studies are complete. Attending your visa interview in person is required, though there are a few rare exceptions (e.g., if you are younger than 14 or older than 80 years of age, or if you meet certain visa renewal requirements). 
Cost: Your DS-160 payment covers the cost
Where to apply: Scheduling portal for your visa interview
After you successfully complete your visa interview, you will be granted your F-1 visa and acquire F-1 status. You are now cleared to study in the USA! 
Refer to Travel.state.gov to learn more. If you need any help with preparing or submitting your application, Shorelight provides application assistance for international students.
Before you attend your visa interview, make sure to have the following documents ready for evaluation by the consular officer:
A valid passport
A copy of the photo you will use for your visa
Printed copies of your DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmations
I-20 form
School transcript and official test scores cited on your university application
Diploma (if applicable)
Bank statements or other proof of finances
During your interview, the consular officer may request additional documents. To prepare, consider bringing the following documents:
Academic records such as transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates from schools you attended
Standardized test scores required by your US institution
Evidence of your intent to depart the United States upon completion of your course of study
Statements proving your ability to pay all educational, living, and travel costs
As an international student, you might feel uncertain about your upcoming interview. While feeling nervous is normal, do not forget to take a deep breath and remember that you are well prepared! Your interview is important, but should not be stressful.
Your interviewer will ask questions to determine: 
Are you a legitimate student?
Do you have the resources to pay for your studies?
Do you plan to return home after completing your degree?
To prepare for your F-1 student visa interview, here are some questions you might be asked: 
Why did you pick this university?
Which other US universities did you apply to?
How will you pay for your education?
Do you have relatives in the USA?
Do you plan to work while in the USA?
What do you plan to do after graduation?
Your Shorelight advisor can help you prepare for your interview by giving you a detailed overview of what the process will involve. They can also help you practice with mock interviews! Shorelight’s F-1 student visa interview guide can also help you learn more about what you can do to prepare for your upcoming interview. 
There is a possibility that your F-1 visa application will be denied. If this happens, you will be given detailed reasoning in writing, including the section of the law that led to the denial of your application.  
To avoid having your F-1 student visa application denied, it is important to read and follow all instructions carefully. Always double- and triple-check your documents before submitting your application. Shorelight advisors can offer visa assistance to make this process easier for you: They are happy to help you organize all the documents you will need, in the correct formats, and on schedule. 
Remember: During your F-1 student visa interview, you want to sufficiently demonstrate that you are traveling to the US to study and planning to return to your home country once your program is complete. Keep this in mind as you answer your interview questions.
As an international student, you must actively maintain your F-1 status to continue studying in the US. To do this, you must comply with both university regulations and codes of conduct, as well as with the requirements and conditions set out in your F-1 visa requirements. 
When entering the US:
Make sure to enter the US no more than 30 days before your program begins.
As soon as you arrive in the country, contact your designated school official (DSO).
When you arrive at your university, contact your DSO again before the start date listed on your I-20 form.
While studying in the US:
Attend all your classes and maintain good academic standing. If you require support with any of your classes, your Shorelight advisor can direct you to academic resources to help you improve.
If you need extra time to complete your program which would exceed the end date specified in your I-20, speak with your DSO to discuss your options for possible extensions.
Make sure to enroll for a full course of study when your academic term is in session.
If you want to drop a class or change classes, make sure to speak to your DSO first.
If you want to take a break and/or go on vacation, remember to first complete at least one full academic year at your institution.  After your holiday, you must also register for classes in the next academic term.
Yes, you will be able to work in the US on a F-1 student visa. However, you will have to follow certain F-1 visa rules and restrictions:
You can only work part time on campus while your academic term is in session
You can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week
You may be able to work off campus with the approval of your university
During academic breaks, you will be permitted to work full time, if your university allows it. You can learn more about working as a F-1 international student by referring to USCIS.gov.
When searching for work while you study, make sure to seek approval from your DSO first. 
Keep in mind, once you finish your program, you will have a grace period of 60 days to leave the US. If you wish to extend your stay, you can speak to a Shorelight advisor to explore your options, such as transferring to another school or pursuing further education. You can also refer to Shorelight’s F-1 extension guide to have a look at your options.
Now that you know how US non-immigrant visas work for international students, create a checklist of next steps and get started. The sooner you begin fulfilling the USA study visa requirements, the better chance you will have of securing your spot at an American university.

On April 2, 2024, the U.S.
While studying in the United States, it is important to maintain your F or M student status. Your status relates to the purpose, or reason for why you want to come to the United States. The U.S. Department of State issues you your visa based on your intended purpose. 
If the Department of State issues you an F or M student visa, this means that you are coming to the United States to study. You should not take any action that detracts from that purpose. Maintaining your status means:
Fulfilling the purpose for why the Department of State issued you your visa.
Following the regulations associated with that purpose.
F-1 and M-1 students share the same primary purpose for coming to the United States however, F-1 students enroll in more traditional academic programs, while M-1 students enroll in vocational programs. Because these two types of programs are different in nature, the types of benefits an international student may be eligible for and how long they may remain in the country depend on whether they are an F-1 or M-1 student.  Learn more about these specific differences by reviewing the F&M Student Status: Know the Difference infographic.
Below are actions to take in order to properly maintain your status.
When arriving to the United States, both F and M students must:
Enter the United States no more than 30 days before your program of study begins.
Immediately contact your designated school official (DSO) when you enter the United States.
When you arrive at school, you need to contact your DSO again, no later than the program start date listed on your Form I-20, ""Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.""
While studying in the United States, both F and M students must:
F-1 students must complete at least one full academic year at an SEVP-certified school to be eligible for annual vacation. Additionally, students must intend to register for classes in the academic term following their annual vacation.
SEVP-certified schools should have clear and consistent policies regarding annual vacation and comply with the requirements laid out in SEVP Policy Guidance for Adjudicators 1408-01: Academic Year.
Please note that during an annual vacation, students can take as many, as few or no courses as they want. SEVP considers all study during an annual vacation incident to status.
An F student may only work when authorized by a DSO in some cases, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in others. If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately, and you may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date. 
F students are also eligible for optional practical training during or following the program of study. OPT is a form of temporary employment that directly relates to your program of study. 
For more information about employment and training options available for F-students, visit the Working in the United States page and talk with your DSO.
M-1 students are not eligible for employment during their program of study, but may obtain authorization for practical training employment. You may participate in practical training employment after the completion of your vocational program. 
If you want to participate in practical training employment in the United States, talk with your DSO about your options. Practical training employment requires your DSO’s recommendation and authorization from USCIS. 
If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately. You may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date.
F and M students must take action to maintain legal status or depart the United States after completing your program of study.
Once you complete your program of study and any authorized period of practical training, F students have 60 days after completion of your program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. If you wish to extend your stay in the United States, talk with your DSO to learn more about doing one of the following:
Transfer to another school.
Change your education level (e.g. bachelor’s to master’s).
Apply to change status  to another visa status (e.g. H-1B-temporary worker; O-extraordinary ability in science, art or business; P-athlete).
M students have 30 days after completion of their program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. The latest date you may remain in the United States is the “admit until” date on your Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record,” unless you filed for an extension with USCIS.
If you are an F or M student studying in the United States, your DSO should be the first person you talk with if you have any questions regarding the legal requirements of your stay in the United States. Your DSO can assist in answering your questions or help you find someone who can help.
M-1 students should speak with their DSO if they are planning to do any of the following:
Take a break from school.
Travel outside the United States.
Move to a new address.
Request a program extension.
Both F and M students may contact SEVP by email at sevp@ice.dhs.gov if your DSO is unable to assist you or if you would prefer to ask someone else.
In your email, please describe your situation and include any questions you have. SEVP provides responses on a first-come, first-served basis. Answer times may vary depending on the current number of inquiries.

An F1 visa allows international students to study full time at a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) approved university in the United States. F1 visa costs are around $510 per application, and you should apply at least three months before your course start date.
Part-time work is very restricted on an F1 visa. You may be able to work on-campus at your chosen university, however hours are limited and jobs are in high demand.
Find your perfect programs in the USA
If you have any family or children that will need to accompany you during your study time in the US, they will have to apply and be approved for an F2 visa. 
Contact your chosen university before they issue your I-20, and inform them of any children under 21 or a spouse that will be joining you in the US. You will then be sent their I-20 forms along with your own I-20.
Your university may need proof that you can support yourself as well as any dependents before sending you the paperwork.
Before you apply you’ll need to gather the necessary documents. Some of these are specific immigration forms, and others may be copies of financial documents such as bank statements.
Here’s a list of all the documents you may need for your F1 application:
The documents will also need to be taken to your visa interview.
The F1 visa interview is in English, and happens in front of a visa officer at a US embassy or consulate. The interview is usually straightforward and quick, and may only last around five minutes. The F1 visa interview questions you are asked during the interview vary but often concern your chosen program, academic achievements, finances, post-graduation plans, and choice of university.
It is important that you can show you have no plans to remain in the US when your program finishes. It is often necessary that you always have the funds available to buy a plane ticket home for the end of your program.
The time it takes to get your F1 visa can vary from just a week to a couple of months, depending on the complexity of your case. 
In most cases, your application will only take a few days to process, and then you'll need to allow another two or three days for the delivery of your updated passport. 
However, you should apply at least three months before your departure date to make sure you get your visa in time.
If you are declined for an F1 visa you are usually able to apply again, but you will need to start the process from the beginning. You won’t need to pay the SEVIS fee again, but any application fees will need to be paid a second time.
You’ll be told the reason that you were denied, and if you can amend any issues, you may have a better chance next time around. Common issues for a rejected application include:
You can re-apply three times in a year, but if you are struggling to get your application accepted then you should speak to consular officers about your situation before applying again.

Working in the USA,"Register Now!






	If you are an international student studying in the US, you have the opportunity to work part-time but remember that
	you are restricted by the terms of your visa. It is a MUST that you know all the requirements and
	restrictions concerning your visa!


	Please be sure to visit
	our international student immigration center to learn more about
	your visa and consult an immigration attorney if you have any questions.


	Most international students in the United States hold
	an F1 visa,
	which is the U.S. non-immigrant student visa. F1 students are allowed to work in the United States, but only under
	certain conditions and in accordance with complex guidelines and restrictions issued by the United States
	Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS).


	Generally, all employment is contingent on remaining within the terms and restrictions of your F1 visa. There are
	several categories of employment during the term of your stay as an F1 student in the United States. On-campus
	employment is the most freely available, and then there are four categories of off-campus employment:

On-campus employment is the category most freely permitted by the USCIS regulations, and it does
	not require USCIS approval. However, although F1 status includes an on-campus employment privilege, on-campus
	employment opportunities at most schools are limited. Even if you can obtain a job on campus, you may not rely on it
	to prove financial resources for the year, and often these jobs are not related to your studies. Many schools do
	require that you obtain permission from the International Student Office prior to accepting any on-campus
	employment, and may not permit such employment in a student's first semester or year.

For on-campus work, an F1 student is subject to the following rules:
 The definition of on-campus employment includes:
Since your status is always contingent on your school's support, you must seek guidance and clearance from your
	International Student Office prior to applying for or accepting any employment and you should request their
	particular interpretation of any ambiguous situation. You will also need your school's guidance to ensure that you
	file all appropriate forms with USCIS and receive any necessary USCIS approval.

International students in the U.S. in valid F1 immigration status are permitted to work off-campus in optional
	practical training (OPT) status both during and after completion of their degree. Rules established by the U.S.
	Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) govern the implementation of OPT, and all OPT employment requires prior
	authorization from USCIS and from your school’s International Student Office.

You can apply for OPT after being enrolled for at least 9 months, but you cannot begin employment until you receive
	your Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from USCIS and you have been enrolled for at least a year. You do not
	need to have a job offer to apply for your OPT EAD, and your OPT employment can occur anywhere in the US. Start
	early—USCIS takes up to 90 days to process your application—and make sure you work closely with your school’s
	International Student Office. As with everything you will do while in the U.S., permission is based on maintaining
	lawful F1 status and your International Student Office is there to help you maintain that status throughout your
	stay.

One Final Note – Be mindful of the travel regulations governing F1 students
	on OPT. If you leave the country after completion of your degree, but before receiving your EAD and obtaining a job,
	you may not be readmitted. You can leave the country after completion of your degree if you have your EAD and a job,
	but make sure you bring everything that you’ll need to get back in (including valid passport, valid EAD card, valid
	F1 visa, all your I-20s with page 3 endorsed for travel by your international student advisor within the past 6
	months, and a letter of employment, including dates of employment and salary).


			In April 2008, the Department of Homeland Security updated their OPT requirements for students who are
			studying certain degree programs so that OPT can be extended for an additional 17 months, up to a total of
			29 months of OPT. This was instituted to plug the gap between students who completed their OPT and did not
			have a chance to file for an H1B visa due to the time frames and visa caps that exist on the H1B visa.
			Students can now extend their OPT so they still have the opportunity to apply for an H1B visa.
		

			The special extension of the OPT program is only available to those who are employed by companies who are
			enrolled in the E-Verify program, and you have to be studying one of the following subjects:
		
Curricular Practical Training (CPT)	is an off-campus employment option for F1 students when the practical training is an integral part of the
	established curriculum or academic program. CPT employment is defined as “alternative work/study, internship,
	cooperative education, or any other type of required internship or practicum that is offered by sponsoring employers
	through cooperative agreements with the school.” To qualify, the work experience must be required for your degree,
	or academic credit must awarded. And yes, you can get paid for CPT employment. Prior authorization by your school’s
	International Student Office and notification to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) is required.

Your International Student Office must authorize you for CPT. Once you receive CPT authorization, you can only work
	for the specific employer and for the specific dates authorized (unlike with OPT or severe economic hardship
	off-campus employment, where you can work anywhere in the US). Your CPT authorization will also specify whether you
	are approved for part-time (20 hours per week or less) or full-time (more than 20 hours per week) CPT employment.
	While in school, you can only be approved for part-time CPT.

Regardless of whether you are approved for full or part-time on CPT, there is no limit to how long you can work.
	However, if you work full-time on CPT for 12 months or more, you are not eligible for OPT. If you work part-time on
	CPT, or full-time on CPT for less than 12 months, you are still eligible for all of your allowable OPT. So make sure
	you watch the dates and hours closely – don’t jeopardize your OPT!

As with all employment, you should work closely with your International Student Office. The general rules will apply
	somewhat differently to undergraduates, graduate students and PhD candidates, and they can guide you. The office can
	help you determine your eligibility for CPT, make sure your job offer qualifies, and make sure you follow all
	necessary steps in applying to USCIS. They also have to authorize your CPT, so you have no choice – you have to work
	with them. But they are pros, especially when it comes to USCIS regulations, so use them – they are there to help
	you.

Any F1 student suffering ""severe economic hardship"" as defined by USCIS is eligible to work off-campus for
	up to 20 hours per week while school is in session, and full-time during breaks.

 Examples of Severe Economic Hardship:

			The rule gives examples of the types of things that could be considered ""severe economic hardship
			caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the student’s control."" These circumstances may include:
		
You must apply for an ""employment authorization document"" (EAD) with the help and guidance of your
	International Student Office -- you do not need a job offer before you apply for the EAD. But several forms and
	documents are required, together with fees and photos, etc., and processing can take up to 12 weeks or longer -- and
	you cannot start work until you receive the EAD. Once you receive the EAD, you may work for an employer at any job,
	anywhere in the United States. Employment authorization is automatically terminated when a student fails to maintain
	valid F1 status.

The final category of employment for international students in the U.S. on F1 visas is employment with a ""recognized
	international organization."" To qualify, an organization must be on the official State Department list, and listed
	organizations include the Red Cross, African and Asian Development Banks, the World Health Organization, the World
	Trade Organization, and many other similar but less well-known organizations. Because it does not have the universal
	application of OPT or CPT, this category of employment is often overlooked. Only students with a job offer and
	sponsorship from one of the listed organizations are eligible. However, for those lucky students who do have such
	sponsorship, there are clear benefits of this employment category.

If you meet these requirements, you can apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from the United States
	Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). You can start to work only after you receive your EAD, which can take
	up to 3 months.

 Advantages of this type of employment when compared to CPT or
				OPT:

Student Visa


Exchange Visitor Visa


Generally, a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

Conservatory
Another academic institution, including a language training program
Vocational or other recognized nonacademic institution, other than a language training program

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.
While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa.  However, once you depart the United States you must apply for a new visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.

If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website. 
If you are interested in changing to F or M Student Status, see the Changing to a Nonimmigrant F or M Student Status page.

"F-1 Visas for International Students: Requirements, Rules ...","Get ready to study abroad in America with our step-by-step guide to F-1 visa rules. 
Students wishing to study in the United States need to learn about the F-1 student visa application process. There are more than one million international students currently studying abroad in the USA, and with some preparation and guidance, you can join them. To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. The I-20 form provided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with your F-1 visa after graduation.
Have questions about the student visa process? Attend an upcoming Shorelight webinar > 
There are several F-1 visa rules to keep in mind if you plan to apply for a F-1 student visa. You must meet these requirements for your application to be accepted:
Institution certification—The college or the university where you plan to study needs to be approved by SEVP Immigration & Customs Enforcement.
Full-time enrollment—You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution while your academic term is in session.
English language proficiency—You must meet the required English language proficiency score of the institution you are attending or be enrolled in courses that will help you improve your English proficiency.
Sufficient funding—You must prove you have sufficient funds available to finance your studies and living expenses while in the US.
Valid passport—Your passport should be valid for US travel for at least six months after your program completion date.
Home country residency—You are required to have a residence in your home country to return to following the completion of your degree.

Before you begin your F-1 visa application, you must take the following steps:
Get accepted by a SEVP-certified institution before submitting your visa application. When you are accepted, you will receive your I-20 form, which you will need to apply for your F-1 visa.
Pay your SEVIS fee.
Complete your DS-160 visa application.
Schedule your visa interview.
Attend your visa interview.
If you are applying for a F-1 visa from India, Shorelight’s F-1 visa for Indian students guide is for you.
Once these steps are completed, you will be ready to complete and submit your F-1 student visa application. 
1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US government’s way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education. 
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay. 
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials. 
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., like getting a US driver’s license). 
Helpful resources: Confirm your US university is a SEVP-accredited institution 
Keep your Shorelight enrollment advisor updated through every step of the visa process – when you submit your application, schedule your visa interview, and, of course, when your visa application is approved.
2. Pay Your SEVIS Fee
The total cost for your F-1 student visa will be approximately $510, which includes the cost of the visa itself, plus SEVIS processing and maintenance fees. 
Requirements: Your I-20
Cost: $350 
Where to apply: Payment portal for your SEVIS fee
Make sure to save the I-901 SEVIS fee receipt. You will need it for your visa interview. 
3. Complete Your DS-160 Visa Application
Your DS-160 is your visa application. All prospective international students must complete a DS-160 to receive an F-1 visa. 
Requirements: Your I-20, passport, travel itinerary, photo for your visa
Cost: $160 
Where to apply: Application portal for your DS-160
After you successfully submit your DS-160, you will receive a printed confirmation with a barcode on it. Save this form – you will need it for your visa interview. 
4. Schedule Your Visa Interview
Find the nearest US embassy or consulate and schedule your visa interview. Wait times will vary by country and can take months — so remember to set up your appointments as early as possible!
If you are enrolling at a US university through Shorelight, ask your enrollment advisor about student visa interview tips or how to set up a mock interview session. Practicing your visa interview in advance will make you feel more comfortable with the process.
Ask your Shorelight advisor to set up a mock visa interview for you.
5. Attend Your Visa Interview
During the interview portion of the F-1 visa application process, the US consulate or embassy confirms you are coming to study as a legitimate, serious student. In your visa interview, you must also prove you have the funds to cover your time studying in the US, and confirm that you plan on returning home after your studies are complete. Attending your visa interview in person is required, though there are a few rare exceptions (e.g., if you are younger than 14 or older than 80 years of age, or if you meet certain visa renewal requirements). 
Cost: Your DS-160 payment covers the cost
Where to apply: Scheduling portal for your visa interview
After you successfully complete your visa interview, you will be granted your F-1 visa and acquire F-1 status. You are now cleared to study in the USA! 
Refer to Travel.state.gov to learn more. If you need any help with preparing or submitting your application, Shorelight provides application assistance for international students.
Before you attend your visa interview, make sure to have the following documents ready for evaluation by the consular officer:
A valid passport
A copy of the photo you will use for your visa
Printed copies of your DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmations
I-20 form
School transcript and official test scores cited on your university application
Diploma (if applicable)
Bank statements or other proof of finances
During your interview, the consular officer may request additional documents. To prepare, consider bringing the following documents:
Academic records such as transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates from schools you attended
Standardized test scores required by your US institution
Evidence of your intent to depart the United States upon completion of your course of study
Statements proving your ability to pay all educational, living, and travel costs
As an international student, you might feel uncertain about your upcoming interview. While feeling nervous is normal, do not forget to take a deep breath and remember that you are well prepared! Your interview is important, but should not be stressful.
Your interviewer will ask questions to determine: 
Are you a legitimate student?
Do you have the resources to pay for your studies?
Do you plan to return home after completing your degree?
To prepare for your F-1 student visa interview, here are some questions you might be asked: 
Why did you pick this university?
Which other US universities did you apply to?
How will you pay for your education?
Do you have relatives in the USA?
Do you plan to work while in the USA?
What do you plan to do after graduation?
Your Shorelight advisor can help you prepare for your interview by giving you a detailed overview of what the process will involve. They can also help you practice with mock interviews! Shorelight’s F-1 student visa interview guide can also help you learn more about what you can do to prepare for your upcoming interview. 
There is a possibility that your F-1 visa application will be denied. If this happens, you will be given detailed reasoning in writing, including the section of the law that led to the denial of your application.  
To avoid having your F-1 student visa application denied, it is important to read and follow all instructions carefully. Always double- and triple-check your documents before submitting your application. Shorelight advisors can offer visa assistance to make this process easier for you: They are happy to help you organize all the documents you will need, in the correct formats, and on schedule. 
Remember: During your F-1 student visa interview, you want to sufficiently demonstrate that you are traveling to the US to study and planning to return to your home country once your program is complete. Keep this in mind as you answer your interview questions.
As an international student, you must actively maintain your F-1 status to continue studying in the US. To do this, you must comply with both university regulations and codes of conduct, as well as with the requirements and conditions set out in your F-1 visa requirements. 
When entering the US:
Make sure to enter the US no more than 30 days before your program begins.
As soon as you arrive in the country, contact your designated school official (DSO).
When you arrive at your university, contact your DSO again before the start date listed on your I-20 form.
While studying in the US:
Attend all your classes and maintain good academic standing. If you require support with any of your classes, your Shorelight advisor can direct you to academic resources to help you improve.
If you need extra time to complete your program which would exceed the end date specified in your I-20, speak with your DSO to discuss your options for possible extensions.
Make sure to enroll for a full course of study when your academic term is in session.
If you want to drop a class or change classes, make sure to speak to your DSO first.
If you want to take a break and/or go on vacation, remember to first complete at least one full academic year at your institution.  After your holiday, you must also register for classes in the next academic term.
Yes, you will be able to work in the US on a F-1 student visa. However, you will have to follow certain F-1 visa rules and restrictions:
You can only work part time on campus while your academic term is in session
You can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week
You may be able to work off campus with the approval of your university
During academic breaks, you will be permitted to work full time, if your university allows it. You can learn more about working as a F-1 international student by referring to USCIS.gov.
When searching for work while you study, make sure to seek approval from your DSO first. 
Keep in mind, once you finish your program, you will have a grace period of 60 days to leave the US. If you wish to extend your stay, you can speak to a Shorelight advisor to explore your options, such as transferring to another school or pursuing further education. You can also refer to Shorelight’s F-1 extension guide to have a look at your options.
Now that you know how US non-immigrant visas work for international students, create a checklist of next steps and get started. The sooner you begin fulfilling the USA study visa requirements, the better chance you will have of securing your spot at an American university.

"The F-1 Student Visa, Explained","Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
What is the F-1 visa?
The F-1 visa allows a student to temporarily live in the United States for a defined period of time while studying at a school, college, seminary, or conservatory.
Is the F-1 visa right for me?
For many students, the chance to study in the United States is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. Unless the person is already a U.S. citizen or green card holder, all prospective students will have to apply for a visa to study in the United States.
Because there are so many courses and places to study in the United States, the F-1 visa has a pretty broad application but also some very clear rules. The first is that you have to be coming to the United States with the intent to temporarily study. In other words, this is not an immigrant visa.
You must be studying at an academic institution, not training at a vocational school, as this will require an M-1 visa. Your academic institution must be approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning it needs to be accredited to be able to accept foreign students on F-1 visas.
You will be able to work, but because this is a non-immigrant visa, you will be restricted to where you can work and the type of work. Finally, although your spouse and children can come with you, they will not be able to work but your children can enroll in schools. They will be on F-2 visas and tied to your visa’s status.
Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have. Learn more about what we do to help.
The requirements for an F-1 visa are:
For many students, the process of applying and being accepted into a U.S. academic institution is the lengthiest part. The visa process is a series of steps that take place after you accept an enrollment offer. Not sure if you qualify for an F-1 student visa? Start by checking your eligibility.
Congratulations, you have been accepted into a course of study by a U.S. academic institution! Years of hard work probably led you to this milestone, so here’s the process to obtain your student visa.
After your SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be added to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVP uses SEVIS to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M, and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.
Once you have registered with SEVIS, you will need to pay the I-901 fee. This fee is currently $350 for most people, and funds the SEVP program.
Your SEVP-approved school will then issue you a Form I-20. This form is incredibly important as it confirms your acceptance at the school, and therefore your eligibility for the F-1 visa. Once this Form I-20 has been issued, you will be able to apply to a U.S. embassy or consulate for your F-1 visa.
The steps required will vary between different U.S. embassies or consulates, so make sure you check their websites for further information.
However, you must complete the Form DS-160, which is similar to the Form DS-260 for immigrant visas. The form is very detailed and can take some time to fill in, so make sure you set aside plenty of time to complete it.
Once you have completed the Form DS-160, you will need to schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, unless you are under 13 years of age or over 80 years of age. The U.S. Department of State says you should schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country where you live. You may schedule your interview at another U.S. embassy or consulate, but be aware that it may be more difficult to qualify for a visa outside of the country where you live.
Prior to your interview, you will need to pay the $185 application fee and also, depending on your nationality, pay an issuance fee, as well. The visa issuance fee is only due after your interview, if your visa is approved. The next step will be an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate.
Visa wait times can vary depending on the time of year and location. You can use the appointment wait time tool to see how long you will have to wait for an appointment at a specific U.S. embassy or consulate.
At this stage, it is important to note that F-1 visas for new students can only be issued up to 365 days (one year) in advance of the start date for a course of study. It used to be 120 days, but in February, 2023, the State Department extended the period.
Note: For existing F-1 visas, this is not the case and visas can be issued any time, as long as the student is currently enrolled at a SEVP-approved school or institution and in SEVIS.
Boundless not only makes it easy for you to complete your F-1 student visa application, but we can also help you get ready for your visa interview. Learn more about what you get with Boundless.
You will generally be required to attend an interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate. You will need to bring:
You should also be prepared to bring evidence of:
During your interview, the consular officer will ask you questions to determine whether or not to approve your F-1 visa. Make sure you are complete and accurate in your answers, as you will be under oath. For interview tips, see the Boundless guide on preparing for the F-1 student visa interview.
The consular officer will also take your fingerprints, although this will vary depending on your location. After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing. The consular officer will let you know if this is required.
Once your interview is complete, you will be informed of the outcome and, if successful, be issued a visa to study in the United States.
Get exclusive visa interview prep materials from a former U.S. consular officer when you work with Boundless on your student visa application. Learn more.
Yes, you can bring your spouse and children with you. Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
F-1 students cannot work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students can engage in three types of off-campus employment:
This depends on your individual taxation situation, but typically you might be required to file a U.S. tax return. For more information, seek advice from a qualified tax professional.
Generally, an F-1 student may transfer between SEVP-certified schools. However, this does involve paperwork and coordination. See here for more detailed instructions.
There are some programs and visas available for F-1 visa holders after you finish studying in the United States. These can be highly individual to your circumstances, field of study, and professional background, so do your research carefully.

You don’t have to navigate the F-1 student visa process alone. Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have along the way. Learn more about what we do to help.

F1 Visa - US Student Visa Requirements and Application ...,"In this article

US student visa requirements, eligibility criteria, the application steps and FAQs
In this article
The F1 visa is a student visa that is given to international students who want to attend educational institutions in the United States. It covers levels from elementary school to university and graduate school, including other degrees.
To qualify to even apply for an F1 visa you must meet some specific conditions, such as:
Here are the documents required to apply for an F1 Visa:
To application process for the F1 visa goes through the following steps:
After you apply and are accepted into the school you want to attend, they will have to complete some procedures so that you can apply for the F1 visa. The most important document you need to have is Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status. Without this form, you will not be able to apply for an F1 student visa and attend your interview.
After you get your Form I-20, you can start the usual application process. This includes filing the DS-160 form online with the necessary information about your visa status.
The application fee for the student visa is $185. You must pay this fee and get the receipt, which you will need later for your interview documents. You might have to pay additional fees based on your country of origin and the US Embassy you are applying from.
When you are admitted by the SEVP institution, your school immediately registers you in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). To have full registration, there is a SEVIS I-901 fee. For the F1 visa, this fee is $200.
After filing the DS-160 form and paying the fees, you will need to schedule your interview. The interview is a mandatory step before you get your student visa. Try to schedule it as early as possible, since there might be delays due to the heavy workload of the US Embassy. When you schedule it, you will receive an interview appointment letter which you will need later on in the application process.
Before you go to attend your interview, you should prepare your file with the required documents for students.
When you go to attend the student visa interview, the questions will mostly revolve around your reasons for going to the US and the institution you are going to. The interviewer will try to assess whether you intend to return to your home country after you complete your degree.
When your visa is approved, it might be for the full time that you will be in school in the US, or for less. If your study program takes 1 year to graduate, the Embassy will most likely give you a visa that is valid for 1 year If your degree program is 2 years and you only get the visa for 1 year, you should then later apply to renew it. In this case, it is the best option to renew the F1 visa.
The validity of your F1 visa is for as long as it is stated on your I-20 form and I-94 form which is given to you when you enter the US.
If you are renewing your visa you should follow the same procedure. You might be able to waive the interview on the reason that you have already done it once and your intent is to continue your education for the remaining years to get your degree.
If your visa is approved, you are allowed to depart for the US 30 days before your program begins. You cannot enter the US any earlier than that.
In most cases, you will get the response on this visa immediately after the interview. At the end of the visa interview, the interviewer might congratulate you for getting the visa or will provide you with a document letting you know the reason for denial. This is because the processing of this type of visa actually happens before your interview. The interview is the last step for the US Embassy to assess whether they should issue the visa.
There are, however, cases where the response and processing of the F1 visa takes a few days, so you should be patient if that happens.
After you are admitted into the institution of your choice, you can apply for the visa 120 days before you are scheduled to start your program. You cannot apply any earlier, but applying later might cause you a delay due to processing times. So as soon as the 120-day countdown begins, make sure you submit your application.
After your visa expires, you have a 60 day grace period to prepare for your departure to your home country. If your visa doesn’t cover the whole time that you will be in school in the US, you will have to apply for renewal or extensions. The extensions are approved only if you can prove you will be completing your degree in the US and you intend to return as soon as it is over.
You may work as an F1 student but only for short periods of time since your visa is a student and not a work visa. You are allowed to work part-time on campus while school is in session and full time during breaks. If you want to work outside of campus, you have two options.
If you, for example, find a job that requires a different type of visa, other than F1, then you are also eligible to change status. You just need to work through the instructions of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and your employer or another petitioner.
Even though you have proved that you have strong ties to your home country, if you want to apply for a Green Card, you are allowed to do so on an F1 visa. It is a complicated procedure, though. You must either self-petition as a person with extraordinary abilities, get married in the US or prove that you will invest $500,000 in the US economy.
If these are not feasible for you, but you still want to remain in the US, the easiest way is to change status into a different type of visa such as an H-1B visa and have your employer sponsor you.
F1 visa students quite often have to travel abroad. They travel during university breaks or in case of emergencies. The travel can be to their own home countries or to other countries.
If you are an F1 visa student who wants to travel abroad, before you plan and book their travel you must follow some instructions. The instructions are to ensure that they can enter the United States again.
In case you have dependents, such as a spouse or unmarried children under 21 years old, they are allowed to come to the US too. This can be done with an F2 visa.
The F2 visa has no cap and dependents should just fulfill the requirements and complete the application procedures to get the visa. To be eligible for an F-2 visa, you must fulfill the following criteria:

International students who wish to enter the United States for the purposes of furthering their studies can apply for an F1 Student Visa.
Call us on +1 844 290 6312 for immediate help & assistance with your situation. We’re here to help you in person, via the phone, or online.

The F1 Visa allows eligible international students who wish to attend a full course of study at colleges, universities, and high schools in the United States. The academic institution attended must be certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). In addition, this student visa can be used by foreign nationals coming to the country to attend a language training program.
While in the country, international students are free not only to study and live in the United States but they can also travel abroad without losing their visa status. In addition, F1 visa holders can open a bank account and obtain a driver’s license.
Furthermore, the F1 Visa cannot be used to attend publicly funded adult education programs. Those who would like to pursue a course of study that is not academic, such as post-secondary vocational or business schools, should apply for an M-1 Visa.
The Student Visa does not have an annual cap, meaning that the visa application can be processed as soon as it is submitted which is only a few business days.
To be eligible for this student visa, international students must meet the following requirements:
If you would like to apply for a student F1 visa, you will first need to apply to a SEVP-approved academic institution. For a list of SEVP-certified schools, you should go to Study in the States to search for a list of approved academic institutions.
You must then be registered in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) where you will need to pay the SEVIS I-901 fee. After the SEVIS fee payment has been made, you will then be issued Form I-20 from your school.
If you have eligible dependents (spouses and unmarried children under 21) that you would like to bring with you to the US, they must also enroll in SEVIS to obtain their individual I-20 Forms for their dependent F2 visas. Dependents do not need to pay the SEVIS fee.
You may then begin the F-1 visa application process at your nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. To do this, the visa applicants will need to complete Form DS-160 (Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application), submit supporting documentation, and attend a visa interview.
You can file your application form online or at your local U.S. Embassy or Consulate. For the F1 Visa, you will need the following supporting documents to make your visa application:
The last step of your application is an interview, which is required to determine whether or not you qualify for a Student Visa. If you are abroad, this will take place at your nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.
At this visa interview, the consular officer will review your documents and ask you questions about your academic qualifications and choice of university. They will ask questions about the course you are planning to take, as well as your reasons behind opting to study in the US.
You will be required to demonstrate your willingness to return to your home country at the end of your course of study and future plans.
Most importantly, you will need to prove that you have enough means to finance your education and your life in the U.S. The interviewer may ask about your income, who is sponsoring your education and how you plan to cover living expenses while studying.
Attending a visa interview can be daunting so make sure you prepare in advance. Try to keep your answers concise and factual.

One of the F-1 Visa requirements is to prove that you do not wish to settle in the United States. To help prove that you do not want to immigrate to the United States, visa applicants must show they maintain strong ties with their home country.
To support their F-1 Visa application, visa applicants may prove their non-immigrant intent by demonstrating the following:
Your visa also indicates the amount of time you can legally stay in the U.S. This usually coincides with the total length of your studies. However, if you need extra time, you can apply for an F-1 Visa renewal.
You need to produce a letter stating the reason for your request so that your designated school official can extend your permit.
If you are going to travel abroad for a short time and your F-1 Visa will expire while you are away, you will need to re-apply for it before you can re-enter the country.
If you fail to maintain your F1 Visa status, you will lose your right to live and study in the U.S.
This can happen as a result of one of the following circumstances:
You can enter the U.S. 30 days before the registration date printed on your Firm I-20. In addition, you have a further 60 day grace period in the country following the completion of your course.
If you have been admitted to a U.S. university, but are still waiting for your I-20, you may travel to the U.S. for a valid reason. For example, you may need to attend your visa interview appointment at the consulate. In this case, you can submit an application for a B-2 Visitor Visa with a “prospective student” annotation. This permit will let you enter the country for a short time.
It should be noted that foreign students may not study after entering on a visitor visa (B2 Visa) or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) unless that study is recreational, non-credit, and an allowed program of study under the B-2 Tourist visa.
To get your F1 Visa status, you must be enrolled in a full-time program. Consequently, you may not have any free time to work. However, in limited circumstances, you may get permission to work part-time on-campus as a part of your practical training only after the first year of study is over. International students on an F-1 visa may engage in the following types of off-campus employment:
Those who would like to work off-campus in other types of off-campus employment can do so if they can prove that they are in severe economic hardship because of unforeseen circumstances. This may include:
As with any other U.S. visa, the F1 Student visa can be denied for a number of reasons. If you receive a rejection, the USCIS will detail the reasons for the denial in the rejection letter after the application has been processed. F1 Student visas can be rejected for a variety of reasons including the following:
To minimize your chances of the visa application being rejected, it is important that you complete the visa application thoroughly and truthfully. To make sure that your application is completed to the highest standard, it is recommended that an immigration lawyer experienced in handling student visas, check the application along with the portfolio of supporting documents.
Furthermore, an immigration attorney can also advise you on your options if you find that your application has been denied.
As well as the cost of education in the United States, international students will be expected to pay the following fees in order to obtain an F-1 visa:

The F1 Visa is a non-immigrant permit for international students, meaning it does not create a path to U.S. settlement. Consequently, you cannot directly move from an F1 visa to a Green Card.
While on a Student Visa, you are not allowed to apply for permanent residence. This would be considered a violation of status, resulting in a temporary ban from the U.S. However, you may try to adjust your status.
One good idea could be to apply for an H-1B visa. This permit is designed for foreign nationals that hold a degree in a specialized field, such as IT, finance, or science.
However, if you do not wish to contend your place with other participants in the annual lottery, you can file your I-129 Form to petition for other visas.
Once you have obtained a dual intent visa, you may immediately file for a Green Card. For example, if you already got a master’s degree, you may want to consider an EB-2 immigrant Green Card.
Before you can petition for a new status, you must have been in F1 status for at least one academic year.
U.S. visa processing time will depend on the U.S. Embassy or Consulate from where the international student is applying. Some embassies and consulates might take longer than others due to a backlog or a heavy workload.
Typically, visas can be processed anywhere from 3 days to several weeks. Of course, this will depend on the strength of the application and that no additional evidence or documents will be required. It should be noted that visa applications that require the submission of additional information can take months to process.
It is currently faster to apply for an F2B visa than an F1 visa. That said, this can change and it is always best to refer to the Department of State’s monthly visa bulletin for progress and updates on the various visas that are available for the US.
If your F1 visa application has been rejected and you wish to receive professional guidance, you can entrust your case with one of our immigration attorneys. IAS will assist in obtaining your F-1 Visa and deliver only the best strategy necessary for your application.

There are many types of immigration statuses for foreign nationals coming to the U.S.  Each has its own purpose, restrictions, and benefits. F-1 and J-1 statuses are designated as full time student statuses.  
When you apply for immigration sponsorship from UChicago, you will be asked to choose between F-1 and J-1 status. Both statuses will allow you to study, and both allow for on-campus and some off-campus work authorization.
Return to top
The eligibility requirements for F-1 and J-1 student status are as follows:

If you're eligible for either F-1 or J-1, you may choose which is most appropriate based on your personal situation. For more, see the comparisons below:

Immediately eligible for up to 20 hours/week of on-campus work authorization; unlimited on-campus work authorization on breaks while remaining in J-1 status but must be reported via this form! 
Spouses in F-2 status may study for recreational purposes (i.e. cooking classes, language classes, ect.) or part-time in a degree program but may not work.
Spouses in J-2 status can study, and are also eligible for work authorization with an approved application to USCIS and EAD
No home residency requirement.
May be subject to 2 year home residency requirement
Main types of off-campus work authorization: 
1) Optional Practical Training (OPT). Eligible after completion of one year of study for up to 12 months per educational level of full-time work authorization related to program of study. Can be used either during or after program of study. Requires application to USCIS; processing takes 3-4 months and requires a fee. Exchange students not eligible. Does not require a job offer, so you can use it after graduation to look for a job.
24 Month STEM Extension: Those who will complete a degree in USCIS-approved STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) field, may be eligible for the 24 month STEM extension, after completing 12 months of regular OPT.  
2) Curricular Practical Training: used by Booth and College Metcalf Fellows most commonly; also available in other units. Used in the summer or part time during the school year after completion of one year of study and while you remain a student.
Main type of off-campus work authorization:
Academic Training (AT). Eligible for off-campus work authorization related to program of study up to 18 months for bachelors and masters students or length of academic program whichever is shorter, up to 36 months for doctoral students. All time used (full-time or part-time) is deducted at a full-time rate. Authorized by OIA. Requires a job offer, so you must have a job lined up before graduation.

	 
If you have another status in the U.S., such as H4, L2, or adjustment applicant, it could be possible to study in those statuses without obtaining either an F-1 or J-1 visa. Visit our page on studying in a status outside of F-1/J-1 for more information.
If you have any questions about choosing a status for study, please do not hesitate to contact our office at international-affairs@uchicago.edu.

Apply For Your U.S. Student Visa: Undergraduate,"
Jump to navigation

The United States government offers three student visa types including F, J, and M.
Before you can apply for an F, J, or M student visa, you must first apply and be accepted by a U.S. institution of higher education that is certified by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP).
Even when an institution is SEVP-certified and able to issue I-20 and DS-2019 forms for use in visa applications, it may not hold national or regional accreditation. The U.S. Department of Education and Council for Higher Education Accreditation databases list accreditation status for all U.S. institutions. Institutions designated by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to place participants in Academic Exchange programs (J visas) must be accredited. Recognition of course credits and degrees by other institutions and by U.S. and international employers is linked to an institution's accreditation. To learn more about accreditation talk to an EducationUSA Adviser in person or online.
Once accepted at an SEVP-certified school, you will receive a Form I-20 or DS-2019 from the institution's international student office to present when you apply for your student visa. Once you receive your form, visit:
1. U.S. Department of State - Consular Affairs (Student Visas)
2. U.S. Department of State - U.S. Embassies and Consulates
3. U.S. Department of Homeland Security - Study in the States
It is important to note that two separate U.S. government agencies are involved with international student arrival and status while studying in the United States. The State Department is responsible for the visa application process and issuing the visa. Once a visa holder arrives in the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then takes over as the responsible agency for entry into the country, as well as issuing and enforcing international student regulations. Please read information from all three sources above before applying for a U.S. student visa. The sites address employment, maintaining your status, and other vital topics.

Nonimmigrant students must comply with certain federal laws and regulations when seeking employment in the United States. Answers to frequently asked questions about on- and off-campus employment are included below (click a button to jump to the content).

The definition for on-campus employment is in 8 CFR 214.2(9)(i).
There are two types of limits on the employment. The work must take place either at your school or at an educationally affiliated (associated with the school’s established curriculum or part of contractually funded research projects at the postgraduate level) off-campus location:
On-campus employment must not displace a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR).
An F-1 student has three main employment-related guidelines:
Not complying with these guidelines for on-campus employment may be a violation of status that could result in the F-1 student having to leave the United States.
The questions above on ""What qualifies as on-campus employment for an F-1 student?"" and ""What are the basic guidelines for on-campus employment?"" define the parameters for on-campus employment.
As the DSO, you have certain responsibilities:
An F-1 student may begin working as much as 30 days before the start of a program of study. They should inform the DSO before they begin work.
If an F-1 student finishes a program (such as a bachelor’s degree) and starts another program of study at the same campus, the student may continue on-campus employment as long as the student plans to enroll in the new program of study for the next term. If otherwise eligible, an F-1 student may continue to work on-campus with a pending application for reinstatement or change of status.
The job must be physically located on the school’s campus or off-campus at the site of an educationally affiliated organization.
Employment on-campus has to be for the school or for a company that contracts with the school to serve students directly.
For example, if your school contracts with a food service company, an F-1 student can work for the company at school facilities but not for the same company at any off-campus locations.
For example, an F-1 student cannot work for a construction company, even if the job site is on the campus.
However, an F-1 student may work for a contractually affiliated company such as a school bookstore, because it provides services to students.
In the case of off-campus locations, educational affiliation means the location meets one of two important criteria:
In the case of on-campus locations, educational affiliation means the location meets the following criteria:
Yes. If an F-1 student finishes one program of study at one educational level (such as a bachelor’s degree) and starts another program of study at the same campus, the student may continue on-campus employment as long as the student plans to enroll for the next term.
Yes.
An F-1 student who is enrolled in school, maintains status and follows the guidelines for on-campus employment may continue to work. The F-1 student should keep a DSO informed of any changes in employer and hours, however.
An F-1 student may only work on-campus after the program end date if continuing the education at the next program level at the same school.
No.
Yes. However, the F-1 student’s total work hours for all jobs cannot exceed 20 hours during the school term. The F-1 student may work full-time during those periods when school is not in session or during the student’s annual break.
No. The 60-day ""grace"" period after graduation or post-completion OPT is for an F-1 student to prepare to leave the United States, unless the student is beginning a new program of study. An F-1 student may consider applying for post-completion OPT to continue working after graduation.
When an F-1 student transfers to a new school, on-campus employment is available to the student only at that school after the record release date. The F-1 student cannot work at the prior school after that date.
No. Per 8 CFR 214.2(f)(18), the only employment in which an F-1 border commuter student may engage is CPT and post-completion OPT.
An F-1 student automatically has permission to work on campus (unless he or she is a border commuter) but still needs to work with a DSO to ensure the job offered qualifies as on-campus employment.
An F-1 student will need certification letters from the DSO and the employer. The student must present these letters to officials at the local Social Security Administration office to get a Social Security number.
If the F-1 student intends to list on-campus employment as a means of financial support, the DSO should enter the dollar amount of the anticipated income in the on-campus employment field in SEVIS when they create the student's initial Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record.
If the student's means of support changes and the student now wants to list on-campus employment, a DSO must update the student's record accordingly.
DSOs may include on-campus employment information in the SEVIS remarks section even if the student does not intend to list this work as a means of support.
DSOs should terminate the student's SEVIS record for unauthorized employment if the student engages in any unauthorized employment or works hours in excess of those allowed.
SEVP recommends that a DSO keep a copy of the letter from each employer that describes the type of work, the affiliation to the school (if needed), and the number of hours the student will work per week.
DSOs should keep a copy of their letters to the Social Security Administration certifying that the student may work on-campus.
F-1 students may work at a campus other than the one at which they attend classes if the other campus meets the following criteria:
An F-1 student needs to talk to their DSO before changing jobs. This will allow the DSO to ensure that the new position qualifies as on-campus employment and to ensure the DSO has the correct employment information in the student's SEVIS record.
The only exception is if the Secretary of DHS suspends this requirement, by means of a Federal Register notice, due to emergent circumstances. The student must demonstrate to you that the extra work is necessary because the emergent circumstance has affected his or her source of support.
DSOs should endorse the student’s Form I-20 with a reference to the Federal Register notice that announced the emergency exception before allowing the student to work more than 20 hours a week.

Regulation that defines off-campus employment for F-1 students is in 8 CFR 214.2 (f)(9)(ii). Generally, it is employment that is for economic need and does not necessarily have to relate to the student's academic course of study.
An F-1 student must show an ability to afford the costs of school and living expenses before entering the United States and should not plan to work off-campus. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will authorize off-campus employment only in cases of severe economic hardship occurring after a student's enrollment in an academic program and after the student has been in F-1 status for at least one full academic year, or in emergent circumstances as defined by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
Emergent Circumstances are world events that affect a specific group of F-1 students and which causes them to suffer severe economic hardship, including, but not limited to natural disasters, wars and military conflicts, national or international financial crises.
Special Student Relief is the suspension of certain regulatory requirements for an F-1 student subsequent to an emergent circumstances determination, affecting any or all of the following on-campus employment, off-campus employment, duration of status, and full course of study.
USCIS makes case-by-case decisions for off-campus employment for students who can show that new, unexpected circumstances beyond their control have created severe economic hardship. These may include the following:
An F-1 student must have remained enrolled for at least one academic year, in status and in good academic standing before USCIS will authorize off-campus employment.
The F-1 student must be unable to get on-campus employment, or the pay from available on-campus employment must be insufficient to meet financial needs.
For each request approval, a DSO must provide the F-1 student with a Form I-20, ""Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,"" endorsed to that effect.
The F-1 student must file a Form I-765, ""Application for Employment Authorization,"" and pay a fee to USCIS. The student should file within 30 days of the day the DSO endorses the Form I-20. If USCIS approves the application, the student will receive a Form I-766, ""Employment Authorization Document,"" (EAD) from USCIS and can begin working.
Approval for off-campus employment is good for one year. If the F-1 student needs to continue working off-campus, the student must re-apply.
The guidelines for off-campus employment based on emergent circumstances are in the authorizing Federal Register notice.
The USCIS website has a listing of notices and memorandums for groups currently allowed relief due to emergent circumstances
First, a DSO should check to see if on-campus employment is available, and only recommend off-campus employment if available on-campus employment is not sufficient to meet the student's financial needs.
A DSO should ensure the student has read and understands the guidelines for off-campus employment.
If the student meets the following criteria, a DSO can recommend off-campus employment:
Off-campus work authorization requires case-by-case approval from USCIS. Approval is not based on the student's choice of employer.
On-campus employment at an off-campus location is available to all F-1 students except border commuter students. An F-1 student does not need USCIS approval. However, the employment must be for an employer educationally affiliated with your school. For more details please see the section about on-campus employment
No. According to 8 CFR 214.2(f)(18), a border commuter student may only engage in practical training, specifically CPT and post-completion OPT.
The process starts when an F-1 student asks the DSO’s permission to seek employment in an off-campus job. After the DSO decides if they should make the recommendation, they enter it in SEVIS. The DSO should print the supporting Form I-20, ""Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,"" sign pages 1 and 3 and give it to the student.
SEVP recommends that a DSO help the student ensure that the supporting evidence for the Form I-765, ""Application for Employment Authorization,"" clearly shows eligibility.
See the F/M Student Employment Overview on the Study in the States SEVIS Help Hub.
The student must file a Form I-765 with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) within 30 days. See the USCIS website for the form and filing information. The student must pay a fee to USCIS. Electronic filing is available. A DSO should make sure the student reads the form carefully and follows the directions.
As part of the supporting evidence, the F-1 student must include the specially endorsed Form I-20 signed on pages 1 and 2 by a DSO.
If you are unable to issue an updated Form I-20, send USCIS a letter of explanation.
Yes. A DSO has the option in SEVIS to cancel their recommendation for off-campus employment – see the SEVIS Help Hub.
The only reasons for granting work authorization for off-campus employment are economic hardship or emergent circumstances. The USCIS officer will base the decision on the following information:
The F-1 student can check online at the USCIS website using the application receipt number.
If USCIS approves an F-1 student's employment authorization application, they will send the student a Form I-766, ""Employment Authorization Document,"" and a letter notifying the student of the decision. In addition, the F-1 student's SEVIS record automatically updates to show the off-campus employment approval.
If denying an application for employment authorization for off-campus employment, USCIS will send the F-1 student a denial letter giving the reason(s) for the denial.
No. If USCIS denies an application for employment authorization, the F-1 student will receive a letter that explains the decision. The student can file a motion (by the deadline given in the letter) with the same office to re-open or to reconsider the decision.
By filing a motion, the F-1 student is asking USCIS to re-examine or reconsider its decision
An F-1 student may apply to have the fee waived. For information see the USCIS website.
No. An F-1 student must wait to receive the approval from USCIS before beginning off-campus employment.
See 8 CFR 214.2(f)(9)(ii) for a full explanation of the limits when school is not in session.
Emergent circumstances are exceptions. The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security may lift the limits temporarily by publishing a notice in the Federal Register.
F-1 students authorized for on-campus employment may exceed 20 hours of work per week during breaks and annual vacation as well.
Authorization lasts for one year. For more information, see the question on When is off-campus employment available?
If an F-1 student has been working off-campus but has an expired current work authorization, may that student continue working while the new Form I-765 is pending?
No. To avoid this situation, an F-1 student should submit new Form I-765 from ninety days to six months before the expiration of the current EAD.
If USCIS does not approve or deny the Form I-765 within 90 days of receiving the application, the F-1 student may apply for interim employment authorization. See the USCIS website for more information.
Yes, work authorization continues as long as the EAD has not expired and the student otherwise maintains F-1 status.
Yes, it is possible for USCIS to reopen and deny the F-1 student application for off-campus employment. A denied application ends the student’s employment authorization. An F-1 student must maintain status and be in good academic standing. Employment authorization automatically ends if that student does not maintain status. One example of a violation of status is working more hours than authorized.
An F-1 student whose EAD has not expired may work at the transfer-out school up to the transfer release date, but not after. An F-1 student who needs to continue working off-campus after the transfer must apply at the transfer-in school.
No. This is not permissible on the current EAD authorized on the basis of recommendation from the transfer-out school. A designated school official (DSO) at the transfer-in school must review the student’s circumstances and make new recommendations, if warranted. The student will have to file a new Form I-765 with supporting documents and fees, but does not have to wait a year before reapplying.
Yes, this is permissible if the F-1 student meets all of the following characteristics:
The DSO must report this action to SEVP in SEVIS by terminating the student’s record for unauthorized employment.
DSOs should stay in touch with F-1 students and emphasize the need to carefully follow the guidelines for off-campus employment.
The off-campus employment authorization ends 1 year after issuance or upon completion of the program (whichever comes first). An F-1 student may be eligible to apply for post-completion optional practical training upon graduation.

The internship must meet certain criteria:

The student must meet certain criteria:
A DSO does not need to consider either of these items:
A border commuter student may not work as this type of intern within the United States. Commuter students may only engage in curricular practical training or post-completion optional practical training.
This student must follow a specific process to complete this application:
Where can DSOs and students find recognized international organizations within the meaning of the International Organization Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669)?
These international organizations are available in 8 CFR 316.20.
As per 8 CFR 214.2(f)(9)(iii), the student must first obtain an internship offer with an international organization then work with the DSO and apply for an Employment Authorization Document with USCIS.
If the DSO decides to certify the student's eligibility, the DSO must enter their recommendation into the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The DSO should then print the supporting Form I-20, sign pages 1 and 2 and give the form to the student.
See the F/M Student Employment Overview on the Study in the States SEVIS Help Hub for detailed instructions.
Yes. A DSO has the option in SEVIS, but only before the student submits the Form I-765 and supporting documentation. See the F/M Student Employment Overview on the Study in the States SEVIS Help Hub for detailed instructions.
The F-1 student can check online at the USCIS website using the application receipt number.
This type of employment can be full-time or part-time. However, the student must be full-time student when the school is in session and maintain status.
This authorization is valid for one year. If the job continues to be available, the student must apply for continued employment authorization six or more months before the authorization expires.
No. See the related question: Where can DSOs and students find recognized international organizations within the meaning of the International Organization Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669)?

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.

Student Visa


Exchange Visitor Visa


Generally, a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

To enter the United States to attend:

Private elementary school
Seminary
Conservatory
Another academic institution, including a language training program
Vocational or other recognized nonacademic institution, other than a language training program

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

"F-1 Visas for International Students: Requirements, Rules ...","Get ready to study abroad in America with our step-by-step guide to F-1 visa rules. 
Students wishing to study in the United States need to learn about the F-1 student visa application process. There are more than one million international students currently studying abroad in the USA, and with some preparation and guidance, you can join them. To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. The I-20 form provided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with your F-1 visa after graduation.
Have questions about the student visa process? Attend an upcoming Shorelight webinar > 
There are several F-1 visa rules to keep in mind if you plan to apply for a F-1 student visa. You must meet these requirements for your application to be accepted:
Institution certification—The college or the university where you plan to study needs to be approved by SEVP Immigration & Customs Enforcement.
Full-time enrollment—You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution while your academic term is in session.
English language proficiency—You must meet the required English language proficiency score of the institution you are attending or be enrolled in courses that will help you improve your English proficiency.
Sufficient funding—You must prove you have sufficient funds available to finance your studies and living expenses while in the US.
Valid passport—Your passport should be valid for US travel for at least six months after your program completion date.
Home country residency—You are required to have a residence in your home country to return to following the completion of your degree.

Before you begin your F-1 visa application, you must take the following steps:
Get accepted by a SEVP-certified institution before submitting your visa application. When you are accepted, you will receive your I-20 form, which you will need to apply for your F-1 visa.
Pay your SEVIS fee.
Complete your DS-160 visa application.
Schedule your visa interview.
Attend your visa interview.
If you are applying for a F-1 visa from India, Shorelight’s F-1 visa for Indian students guide is for you.
Once these steps are completed, you will be ready to complete and submit your F-1 student visa application. 
1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US government’s way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education. 
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay. 
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials. 
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., like getting a US driver’s license). 
Helpful resources: Confirm your US university is a SEVP-accredited institution 
Keep your Shorelight enrollment advisor updated through every step of the visa process – when you submit your application, schedule your visa interview, and, of course, when your visa application is approved.
2. Pay Your SEVIS Fee
The total cost for your F-1 student visa will be approximately $510, which includes the cost of the visa itself, plus SEVIS processing and maintenance fees. 
Requirements: Your I-20
Cost: $350 
Where to apply: Payment portal for your SEVIS fee
Make sure to save the I-901 SEVIS fee receipt. You will need it for your visa interview. 
3. Complete Your DS-160 Visa Application
Your DS-160 is your visa application. All prospective international students must complete a DS-160 to receive an F-1 visa. 
Requirements: Your I-20, passport, travel itinerary, photo for your visa
Cost: $160 
Where to apply: Application portal for your DS-160
After you successfully submit your DS-160, you will receive a printed confirmation with a barcode on it. Save this form – you will need it for your visa interview. 
4. Schedule Your Visa Interview
Find the nearest US embassy or consulate and schedule your visa interview. Wait times will vary by country and can take months — so remember to set up your appointments as early as possible!
If you are enrolling at a US university through Shorelight, ask your enrollment advisor about student visa interview tips or how to set up a mock interview session. Practicing your visa interview in advance will make you feel more comfortable with the process.
Ask your Shorelight advisor to set up a mock visa interview for you.
5. Attend Your Visa Interview
During the interview portion of the F-1 visa application process, the US consulate or embassy confirms you are coming to study as a legitimate, serious student. In your visa interview, you must also prove you have the funds to cover your time studying in the US, and confirm that you plan on returning home after your studies are complete. Attending your visa interview in person is required, though there are a few rare exceptions (e.g., if you are younger than 14 or older than 80 years of age, or if you meet certain visa renewal requirements). 
Cost: Your DS-160 payment covers the cost
Where to apply: Scheduling portal for your visa interview
After you successfully complete your visa interview, you will be granted your F-1 visa and acquire F-1 status. You are now cleared to study in the USA! 
Refer to Travel.state.gov to learn more. If you need any help with preparing or submitting your application, Shorelight provides application assistance for international students.
Before you attend your visa interview, make sure to have the following documents ready for evaluation by the consular officer:
A valid passport
A copy of the photo you will use for your visa
Printed copies of your DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmations
I-20 form
School transcript and official test scores cited on your university application
Diploma (if applicable)
Bank statements or other proof of finances
During your interview, the consular officer may request additional documents. To prepare, consider bringing the following documents:
Academic records such as transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates from schools you attended
Standardized test scores required by your US institution
Evidence of your intent to depart the United States upon completion of your course of study
Statements proving your ability to pay all educational, living, and travel costs
As an international student, you might feel uncertain about your upcoming interview. While feeling nervous is normal, do not forget to take a deep breath and remember that you are well prepared! Your interview is important, but should not be stressful.
Your interviewer will ask questions to determine: 
Are you a legitimate student?
Do you have the resources to pay for your studies?
Do you plan to return home after completing your degree?
To prepare for your F-1 student visa interview, here are some questions you might be asked: 
Why did you pick this university?
Which other US universities did you apply to?
How will you pay for your education?
Do you have relatives in the USA?
Do you plan to work while in the USA?
What do you plan to do after graduation?
Your Shorelight advisor can help you prepare for your interview by giving you a detailed overview of what the process will involve. They can also help you practice with mock interviews! Shorelight’s F-1 student visa interview guide can also help you learn more about what you can do to prepare for your upcoming interview. 
There is a possibility that your F-1 visa application will be denied. If this happens, you will be given detailed reasoning in writing, including the section of the law that led to the denial of your application.  
To avoid having your F-1 student visa application denied, it is important to read and follow all instructions carefully. Always double- and triple-check your documents before submitting your application. Shorelight advisors can offer visa assistance to make this process easier for you: They are happy to help you organize all the documents you will need, in the correct formats, and on schedule. 
Remember: During your F-1 student visa interview, you want to sufficiently demonstrate that you are traveling to the US to study and planning to return to your home country once your program is complete. Keep this in mind as you answer your interview questions.
As an international student, you must actively maintain your F-1 status to continue studying in the US. To do this, you must comply with both university regulations and codes of conduct, as well as with the requirements and conditions set out in your F-1 visa requirements. 
When entering the US:
Make sure to enter the US no more than 30 days before your program begins.
As soon as you arrive in the country, contact your designated school official (DSO).
When you arrive at your university, contact your DSO again before the start date listed on your I-20 form.
While studying in the US:
Attend all your classes and maintain good academic standing. If you require support with any of your classes, your Shorelight advisor can direct you to academic resources to help you improve.
If you need extra time to complete your program which would exceed the end date specified in your I-20, speak with your DSO to discuss your options for possible extensions.
Make sure to enroll for a full course of study when your academic term is in session.
If you want to drop a class or change classes, make sure to speak to your DSO first.
If you want to take a break and/or go on vacation, remember to first complete at least one full academic year at your institution.  After your holiday, you must also register for classes in the next academic term.
Yes, you will be able to work in the US on a F-1 student visa. However, you will have to follow certain F-1 visa rules and restrictions:
You can only work part time on campus while your academic term is in session
You can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week
You may be able to work off campus with the approval of your university
During academic breaks, you will be permitted to work full time, if your university allows it. You can learn more about working as a F-1 international student by referring to USCIS.gov.
When searching for work while you study, make sure to seek approval from your DSO first. 
Keep in mind, once you finish your program, you will have a grace period of 60 days to leave the US. If you wish to extend your stay, you can speak to a Shorelight advisor to explore your options, such as transferring to another school or pursuing further education. You can also refer to Shorelight’s F-1 extension guide to have a look at your options.
Now that you know how US non-immigrant visas work for international students, create a checklist of next steps and get started. The sooner you begin fulfilling the USA study visa requirements, the better chance you will have of securing your spot at an American university.

International Student U.S. Visa Information,"
Jump to navigation


In the United States, there are three primary student visa types: F, J, and M. 
Visa Types
Valid student visas are required to apply to the Department of Homeland Security for admission into the United States at the port of entry. Students' Form I-20 document (F and M visas) or DS-2019 document (J visas), that are issued by their institution, is what allows them to maintain student status in the United States even if a visa expires during their studies. To issue I-20 or DS-2019 documentation for student visas, U.S. institutions must be certified by the Department of Homeland Security SEVP (Student and Exchange Visitor Program) (F, M visas) or designated by the Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (J visas), respectively. 
Although an institution certified by SEVP to issue I-20s (F, M visas), the institution may not hold national or regional accreditation. Recognition of course credits and degrees by other institutions and by U.S. and international employers is linked to an institution's accreditation. The U.S. Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation databases list all U.S. institutions' accreditation. Note that institutions designated by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to place participants in Academic Exchange programs (J visas) must be accredited.
Two separate U.S. government agencies manage international student arrival and status while studying in the United States. The U.S. Department of State is responsible for the initial visa application process and issuance. Once a visa holder arrives in the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then acts as the responsible agency for granting entry into the country, as well as enforcing immigration regulations that affect international students once they are in the United States.

"The F-1 Student Visa, Explained","Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
What is the F-1 visa?
The F-1 visa allows a student to temporarily live in the United States for a defined period of time while studying at a school, college, seminary, or conservatory.
Is the F-1 visa right for me?
For many students, the chance to study in the United States is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. Unless the person is already a U.S. citizen or green card holder, all prospective students will have to apply for a visa to study in the United States.
Because there are so many courses and places to study in the United States, the F-1 visa has a pretty broad application but also some very clear rules. The first is that you have to be coming to the United States with the intent to temporarily study. In other words, this is not an immigrant visa.
You must be studying at an academic institution, not training at a vocational school, as this will require an M-1 visa. Your academic institution must be approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning it needs to be accredited to be able to accept foreign students on F-1 visas.
You will be able to work, but because this is a non-immigrant visa, you will be restricted to where you can work and the type of work. Finally, although your spouse and children can come with you, they will not be able to work but your children can enroll in schools. They will be on F-2 visas and tied to your visa’s status.
Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have. Learn more about what we do to help.
The requirements for an F-1 visa are:
For many students, the process of applying and being accepted into a U.S. academic institution is the lengthiest part. The visa process is a series of steps that take place after you accept an enrollment offer. Not sure if you qualify for an F-1 student visa? Start by checking your eligibility.
Congratulations, you have been accepted into a course of study by a U.S. academic institution! Years of hard work probably led you to this milestone, so here’s the process to obtain your student visa.
After your SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be added to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVP uses SEVIS to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M, and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.
Once you have registered with SEVIS, you will need to pay the I-901 fee. This fee is currently $350 for most people, and funds the SEVP program.
Your SEVP-approved school will then issue you a Form I-20. This form is incredibly important as it confirms your acceptance at the school, and therefore your eligibility for the F-1 visa. Once this Form I-20 has been issued, you will be able to apply to a U.S. embassy or consulate for your F-1 visa.
The steps required will vary between different U.S. embassies or consulates, so make sure you check their websites for further information.
However, you must complete the Form DS-160, which is similar to the Form DS-260 for immigrant visas. The form is very detailed and can take some time to fill in, so make sure you set aside plenty of time to complete it.
Once you have completed the Form DS-160, you will need to schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, unless you are under 13 years of age or over 80 years of age. The U.S. Department of State says you should schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country where you live. You may schedule your interview at another U.S. embassy or consulate, but be aware that it may be more difficult to qualify for a visa outside of the country where you live.
Prior to your interview, you will need to pay the $185 application fee and also, depending on your nationality, pay an issuance fee, as well. The visa issuance fee is only due after your interview, if your visa is approved. The next step will be an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate.
Visa wait times can vary depending on the time of year and location. You can use the appointment wait time tool to see how long you will have to wait for an appointment at a specific U.S. embassy or consulate.
At this stage, it is important to note that F-1 visas for new students can only be issued up to 365 days (one year) in advance of the start date for a course of study. It used to be 120 days, but in February, 2023, the State Department extended the period.
Note: For existing F-1 visas, this is not the case and visas can be issued any time, as long as the student is currently enrolled at a SEVP-approved school or institution and in SEVIS.
Boundless not only makes it easy for you to complete your F-1 student visa application, but we can also help you get ready for your visa interview. Learn more about what you get with Boundless.
You will generally be required to attend an interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate. You will need to bring:
You should also be prepared to bring evidence of:
During your interview, the consular officer will ask you questions to determine whether or not to approve your F-1 visa. Make sure you are complete and accurate in your answers, as you will be under oath. For interview tips, see the Boundless guide on preparing for the F-1 student visa interview.
The consular officer will also take your fingerprints, although this will vary depending on your location. After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing. The consular officer will let you know if this is required.
Once your interview is complete, you will be informed of the outcome and, if successful, be issued a visa to study in the United States.
Get exclusive visa interview prep materials from a former U.S. consular officer when you work with Boundless on your student visa application. Learn more.
Yes, you can bring your spouse and children with you. Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
F-1 students cannot work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students can engage in three types of off-campus employment:
This depends on your individual taxation situation, but typically you might be required to file a U.S. tax return. For more information, seek advice from a qualified tax professional.
Generally, an F-1 student may transfer between SEVP-certified schools. However, this does involve paperwork and coordination. See here for more detailed instructions.
There are some programs and visas available for F-1 visa holders after you finish studying in the United States. These can be highly individual to your circumstances, field of study, and professional background, so do your research carefully.

You don’t have to navigate the F-1 student visa process alone. Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have along the way. Learn more about what we do to help.

Congratulations on your decision to study in the United States. Nonimmigrant students who come to the United States to study must follow specific rules. However, different rules apply depending on your student type and education level. Learn what student type and education level applies to you below:
Student Type:
Education Level:

Your first step is to apply to a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school in the United States. Use the School Search tool to find SEVP-certified schools and programs that are eligible to enroll F-1 and M-1 students. For more information about the types of programs that are available to you, please visit EducationUSA.
If you are a student currently enrolled in the equivalent of a kindergarten through grade 12 program, visit the Kindergarten to Grade 12 page on Study in the States.
The Form I-20
Once you are accepted into an SEVP-certified school, your school’s designated school official will send you a document called the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” The Form I-20 is a paper record of your information in our Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) database. Each school that accepts you will mail you a Form I-20.
For more information, visit the Students and the Form I-20 page.
After receiving your Form I-20, you must pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee.
Federal regulations require all F, M and J students pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee before applying for their U.S. student visa. You can pay your I-901 SEVIS Fee online at FMJfee.com or by using Western Union Quick Pay. You must present the receipt as proof of payment when you apply for visa. It’s important that the SEVIS ID number on your I-901 SEVIS Fee receipt matches your SEVIS ID number on your Form I-20. If it does not, or you encounter other issues paying your fee, please contact SEVP.
I-901 SEVIS Fee Assistance:
Learn more about the I-901 SEVIS Fee:
After paying the I-901 SEVIS Fee and getting a receipt, you must apply for a visa at any U.S. Embassy or Consulate before you come to the United States.
To receive a visa, you will have to participate in an in-person interview. During your visa interview, you will need to establish that you meet the requirements under U.S. law to receive the category of visa for which you are applying. The consular officer will determine if you qualify to receive a visa and which visa category is appropriate based on your purpose of travel.
A visa does not guarantee entrance to the United States; it only permits you to arrive and seek permission to enter the country. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the U.S. port of entry has the final authority to admit entry into the country.
The following pages will assist with this process:
Before you leave for the United States, familiarize yourself with the different documents you will need or could need when you arrive. It is also a good idea to make at least two sets of copies of these documents: one copy to leave with your family before you depart and one copy to give to your school officials. Required documents include your:
It is also smart to have your acceptance letter, proof of financial ability and any other supporting documentation with you, in case the Customs and Border Protection officer asks for them. You should carry your original travel documents on you at all times while traveling. Do not put them in your checked baggage. For more information on traveling to the United States, visit the Getting to the United States page.
When you arrive to the United States you will meet a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry, who will verify your information and determine if you may enter the country.
If the officer cannot initially verify your information, or if you do not have all of the required documentation, you may be directed to an interview area known as “secondary inspection.” Secondary inspection allows inspectors to conduct additional research in order to verify information without causing delays for other arriving passengers.
The inspector will first attempt to verify your status by using SEVIS. In the event that the CBP officer needs to verify information with your school or program, we strongly recommend that you have the name and telephone number of the designated school official (DSO) at your school on hand. If you arrive during non-business hours (evening, weekends, holidays), you should also have an emergency or non-business hour phone number available for this official.
Failure to comply with U.S. government entry-exit procedures may result in your being denied entry to the United States. Under certain circumstances, the CBP officer may issue a Form I-515A, “Notice to Student or Exchange Visitor,” which authorizes temporary admission into the United States. Work with your school without delay to submit the proper documentation required by the Form I-515A. Failing to comply with a Form I-515A will result in the termination of your status. Read SEVP’s Form I-515A Noncompliance Termination procedure to ensure you understand how to properly respond and maintain your status.
If the CBP officer admits you into the country, you will be given a Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record.” This form shows that you have been legally admitted into the United States, the class of admission and your authorized period of stay. It is very important that the information on the record is correct. Inconsistencies between the information on the Form I-94 and SEVIS records can reduce the chances of a successful systems interface and can result in denial of benefits or difficulty re-entering the country.
You have 30 days to enter the country before your official program start date, as listed on your Form I-20. If you do not report to your school by your program start date, your DSO may terminate your SEVIS record. We suggest that you contact your school immediately once you enter the country so that there is no question of your arrival.
If you cannot enter the United States for the term listed on your Form I-20, contact your school officials as soon as possible so that they can update your record so your plans are accurately reflected in SEVIS.
As an F or M student, you will often hear the phrase “maintaining status.” Maintaining your status means that you are fulfilling the purpose for why the U.S. Department of State issued you your visa and following the regulations associated with that purpose. Remember, a student visa is a travel document you receive from a U.S. consulate or embassy before you enter the United States. Your student status is what you must maintain after you are granted entrance into the United States. Learn more about the rules you must follow by talking to your DSO and reviewing the Maintaining Status page on Study in the States.
While studying in the United States, you may be eligible to apply for certain benefits. These student benefits are not granted by SEVP and require students to apply to other government agencies to receive them. The benefits you are eligible for will depend on your student status. Visit the following pages to learn more about potential student benefits:
As a note, most employment and training opportunities require authorization from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). For more information, visit the Employment page on ICE.gov.
If you are having an immediate problem and need assistance quickly, please speak with your DSO or responsible officer. If that person cannot help you, contact the SEVP Response Center at 1-703-603-3400 or at SEVP@ice.dhs.gov.
Once you have completed your program and fulfilled your purpose for coming to the United States, you may have a number of options. These include changing your status, applying for training, transferring to another SEVP-certified school or leaving the country.
Please note there are restrictions that apply to M-1 students regarding transferring and changing status. Talk to your DSO to understand what your options are.
If after your program is complete you do not qualify to stay in the country, or chose to depart, please be advised:
You can also visit USCIS to learn about naturalization and the path to U.S. citizenship.

Working in the USA,"Register Now!






	If you are an international student studying in the US, you have the opportunity to work part-time but remember that
	you are restricted by the terms of your visa. It is a MUST that you know all the requirements and
	restrictions concerning your visa!


	Please be sure to visit
	our international student immigration center to learn more about
	your visa and consult an immigration attorney if you have any questions.


	Most international students in the United States hold
	an F1 visa,
	which is the U.S. non-immigrant student visa. F1 students are allowed to work in the United States, but only under
	certain conditions and in accordance with complex guidelines and restrictions issued by the United States
	Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS).


	Generally, all employment is contingent on remaining within the terms and restrictions of your F1 visa. There are
	several categories of employment during the term of your stay as an F1 student in the United States. On-campus
	employment is the most freely available, and then there are four categories of off-campus employment:

On-campus employment is the category most freely permitted by the USCIS regulations, and it does
	not require USCIS approval. However, although F1 status includes an on-campus employment privilege, on-campus
	employment opportunities at most schools are limited. Even if you can obtain a job on campus, you may not rely on it
	to prove financial resources for the year, and often these jobs are not related to your studies. Many schools do
	require that you obtain permission from the International Student Office prior to accepting any on-campus
	employment, and may not permit such employment in a student's first semester or year.

For on-campus work, an F1 student is subject to the following rules:
 The definition of on-campus employment includes:
Since your status is always contingent on your school's support, you must seek guidance and clearance from your
	International Student Office prior to applying for or accepting any employment and you should request their
	particular interpretation of any ambiguous situation. You will also need your school's guidance to ensure that you
	file all appropriate forms with USCIS and receive any necessary USCIS approval.

International students in the U.S. in valid F1 immigration status are permitted to work off-campus in optional
	practical training (OPT) status both during and after completion of their degree. Rules established by the U.S.
	Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) govern the implementation of OPT, and all OPT employment requires prior
	authorization from USCIS and from your school’s International Student Office.

You can apply for OPT after being enrolled for at least 9 months, but you cannot begin employment until you receive
	your Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from USCIS and you have been enrolled for at least a year. You do not
	need to have a job offer to apply for your OPT EAD, and your OPT employment can occur anywhere in the US. Start
	early—USCIS takes up to 90 days to process your application—and make sure you work closely with your school’s
	International Student Office. As with everything you will do while in the U.S., permission is based on maintaining
	lawful F1 status and your International Student Office is there to help you maintain that status throughout your
	stay.

One Final Note – Be mindful of the travel regulations governing F1 students
	on OPT. If you leave the country after completion of your degree, but before receiving your EAD and obtaining a job,
	you may not be readmitted. You can leave the country after completion of your degree if you have your EAD and a job,
	but make sure you bring everything that you’ll need to get back in (including valid passport, valid EAD card, valid
	F1 visa, all your I-20s with page 3 endorsed for travel by your international student advisor within the past 6
	months, and a letter of employment, including dates of employment and salary).


			In April 2008, the Department of Homeland Security updated their OPT requirements for students who are
			studying certain degree programs so that OPT can be extended for an additional 17 months, up to a total of
			29 months of OPT. This was instituted to plug the gap between students who completed their OPT and did not
			have a chance to file for an H1B visa due to the time frames and visa caps that exist on the H1B visa.
			Students can now extend their OPT so they still have the opportunity to apply for an H1B visa.
		

			The special extension of the OPT program is only available to those who are employed by companies who are
			enrolled in the E-Verify program, and you have to be studying one of the following subjects:
		
Curricular Practical Training (CPT)	is an off-campus employment option for F1 students when the practical training is an integral part of the
	established curriculum or academic program. CPT employment is defined as “alternative work/study, internship,
	cooperative education, or any other type of required internship or practicum that is offered by sponsoring employers
	through cooperative agreements with the school.” To qualify, the work experience must be required for your degree,
	or academic credit must awarded. And yes, you can get paid for CPT employment. Prior authorization by your school’s
	International Student Office and notification to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) is required.

Your International Student Office must authorize you for CPT. Once you receive CPT authorization, you can only work
	for the specific employer and for the specific dates authorized (unlike with OPT or severe economic hardship
	off-campus employment, where you can work anywhere in the US). Your CPT authorization will also specify whether you
	are approved for part-time (20 hours per week or less) or full-time (more than 20 hours per week) CPT employment.
	While in school, you can only be approved for part-time CPT.

Regardless of whether you are approved for full or part-time on CPT, there is no limit to how long you can work.
	However, if you work full-time on CPT for 12 months or more, you are not eligible for OPT. If you work part-time on
	CPT, or full-time on CPT for less than 12 months, you are still eligible for all of your allowable OPT. So make sure
	you watch the dates and hours closely – don’t jeopardize your OPT!

As with all employment, you should work closely with your International Student Office. The general rules will apply
	somewhat differently to undergraduates, graduate students and PhD candidates, and they can guide you. The office can
	help you determine your eligibility for CPT, make sure your job offer qualifies, and make sure you follow all
	necessary steps in applying to USCIS. They also have to authorize your CPT, so you have no choice – you have to work
	with them. But they are pros, especially when it comes to USCIS regulations, so use them – they are there to help
	you.

Any F1 student suffering ""severe economic hardship"" as defined by USCIS is eligible to work off-campus for
	up to 20 hours per week while school is in session, and full-time during breaks.

 Examples of Severe Economic Hardship:

			The rule gives examples of the types of things that could be considered ""severe economic hardship
			caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the student’s control."" These circumstances may include:
		
You must apply for an ""employment authorization document"" (EAD) with the help and guidance of your
	International Student Office -- you do not need a job offer before you apply for the EAD. But several forms and
	documents are required, together with fees and photos, etc., and processing can take up to 12 weeks or longer -- and
	you cannot start work until you receive the EAD. Once you receive the EAD, you may work for an employer at any job,
	anywhere in the United States. Employment authorization is automatically terminated when a student fails to maintain
	valid F1 status.

The final category of employment for international students in the U.S. on F1 visas is employment with a ""recognized
	international organization."" To qualify, an organization must be on the official State Department list, and listed
	organizations include the Red Cross, African and Asian Development Banks, the World Health Organization, the World
	Trade Organization, and many other similar but less well-known organizations. Because it does not have the universal
	application of OPT or CPT, this category of employment is often overlooked. Only students with a job offer and
	sponsorship from one of the listed organizations are eligible. However, for those lucky students who do have such
	sponsorship, there are clear benefits of this employment category.

If you meet these requirements, you can apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from the United States
	Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). You can start to work only after you receive your EAD, which can take
	up to 3 months.

 Advantages of this type of employment when compared to CPT or
				OPT:

On April 2, 2024, the U.S.
While studying in the United States, it is important to maintain your F or M student status. Your status relates to the purpose, or reason for why you want to come to the United States. The U.S. Department of State issues you your visa based on your intended purpose. 
If the Department of State issues you an F or M student visa, this means that you are coming to the United States to study. You should not take any action that detracts from that purpose. Maintaining your status means:
Fulfilling the purpose for why the Department of State issued you your visa.
Following the regulations associated with that purpose.
F-1 and M-1 students share the same primary purpose for coming to the United States however, F-1 students enroll in more traditional academic programs, while M-1 students enroll in vocational programs. Because these two types of programs are different in nature, the types of benefits an international student may be eligible for and how long they may remain in the country depend on whether they are an F-1 or M-1 student.  Learn more about these specific differences by reviewing the F&M Student Status: Know the Difference infographic.
Below are actions to take in order to properly maintain your status.
When arriving to the United States, both F and M students must:
Enter the United States no more than 30 days before your program of study begins.
Immediately contact your designated school official (DSO) when you enter the United States.
When you arrive at school, you need to contact your DSO again, no later than the program start date listed on your Form I-20, ""Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.""
While studying in the United States, both F and M students must:
F-1 students must complete at least one full academic year at an SEVP-certified school to be eligible for annual vacation. Additionally, students must intend to register for classes in the academic term following their annual vacation.
SEVP-certified schools should have clear and consistent policies regarding annual vacation and comply with the requirements laid out in SEVP Policy Guidance for Adjudicators 1408-01: Academic Year.
Please note that during an annual vacation, students can take as many, as few or no courses as they want. SEVP considers all study during an annual vacation incident to status.
An F student may only work when authorized by a DSO in some cases, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in others. If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately, and you may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date. 
F students are also eligible for optional practical training during or following the program of study. OPT is a form of temporary employment that directly relates to your program of study. 
For more information about employment and training options available for F-students, visit the Working in the United States page and talk with your DSO.
M-1 students are not eligible for employment during their program of study, but may obtain authorization for practical training employment. You may participate in practical training employment after the completion of your vocational program. 
If you want to participate in practical training employment in the United States, talk with your DSO about your options. Practical training employment requires your DSO’s recommendation and authorization from USCIS. 
If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately. You may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date.
F and M students must take action to maintain legal status or depart the United States after completing your program of study.
Once you complete your program of study and any authorized period of practical training, F students have 60 days after completion of your program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. If you wish to extend your stay in the United States, talk with your DSO to learn more about doing one of the following:
Transfer to another school.
Change your education level (e.g. bachelor’s to master’s).
Apply to change status  to another visa status (e.g. H-1B-temporary worker; O-extraordinary ability in science, art or business; P-athlete).
M students have 30 days after completion of their program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. The latest date you may remain in the United States is the “admit until” date on your Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record,” unless you filed for an extension with USCIS.
If you are an F or M student studying in the United States, your DSO should be the first person you talk with if you have any questions regarding the legal requirements of your stay in the United States. Your DSO can assist in answering your questions or help you find someone who can help.
M-1 students should speak with their DSO if they are planning to do any of the following:
Take a break from school.
Travel outside the United States.
Move to a new address.
Request a program extension.
Both F and M students may contact SEVP by email at sevp@ice.dhs.gov if your DSO is unable to assist you or if you would prefer to ask someone else.
In your email, please describe your situation and include any questions you have. SEVP provides responses on a first-come, first-served basis. Answer times may vary depending on the current number of inquiries.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.

Congratulations on your decision to study in the United States. Nonimmigrant students who come to the United States to study must follow specific rules. However, different rules apply depending on your student type and education level. Learn what student type and education level applies to you below:
Student Type:
Education Level:

Your first step is to apply to a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school in the United States. Use the School Search tool to find SEVP-certified schools and programs that are eligible to enroll F-1 and M-1 students. For more information about the types of programs that are available to you, please visit EducationUSA.
If you are a student currently enrolled in the equivalent of a kindergarten through grade 12 program, visit the Kindergarten to Grade 12 page on Study in the States.
The Form I-20
Once you are accepted into an SEVP-certified school, your school’s designated school official will send you a document called the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” The Form I-20 is a paper record of your information in our Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) database. Each school that accepts you will mail you a Form I-20.
For more information, visit the Students and the Form I-20 page.
After receiving your Form I-20, you must pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee.
Federal regulations require all F, M and J students pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee before applying for their U.S. student visa. You can pay your I-901 SEVIS Fee online at FMJfee.com or by using Western Union Quick Pay. You must present the receipt as proof of payment when you apply for visa. It’s important that the SEVIS ID number on your I-901 SEVIS Fee receipt matches your SEVIS ID number on your Form I-20. If it does not, or you encounter other issues paying your fee, please contact SEVP.
I-901 SEVIS Fee Assistance:
Learn more about the I-901 SEVIS Fee:
After paying the I-901 SEVIS Fee and getting a receipt, you must apply for a visa at any U.S. Embassy or Consulate before you come to the United States.
To receive a visa, you will have to participate in an in-person interview. During your visa interview, you will need to establish that you meet the requirements under U.S. law to receive the category of visa for which you are applying. The consular officer will determine if you qualify to receive a visa and which visa category is appropriate based on your purpose of travel.
A visa does not guarantee entrance to the United States; it only permits you to arrive and seek permission to enter the country. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the U.S. port of entry has the final authority to admit entry into the country.
The following pages will assist with this process:
Before you leave for the United States, familiarize yourself with the different documents you will need or could need when you arrive. It is also a good idea to make at least two sets of copies of these documents: one copy to leave with your family before you depart and one copy to give to your school officials. Required documents include your:
It is also smart to have your acceptance letter, proof of financial ability and any other supporting documentation with you, in case the Customs and Border Protection officer asks for them. You should carry your original travel documents on you at all times while traveling. Do not put them in your checked baggage. For more information on traveling to the United States, visit the Getting to the United States page.
When you arrive to the United States you will meet a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry, who will verify your information and determine if you may enter the country.
If the officer cannot initially verify your information, or if you do not have all of the required documentation, you may be directed to an interview area known as “secondary inspection.” Secondary inspection allows inspectors to conduct additional research in order to verify information without causing delays for other arriving passengers.
The inspector will first attempt to verify your status by using SEVIS. In the event that the CBP officer needs to verify information with your school or program, we strongly recommend that you have the name and telephone number of the designated school official (DSO) at your school on hand. If you arrive during non-business hours (evening, weekends, holidays), you should also have an emergency or non-business hour phone number available for this official.
Failure to comply with U.S. government entry-exit procedures may result in your being denied entry to the United States. Under certain circumstances, the CBP officer may issue a Form I-515A, “Notice to Student or Exchange Visitor,” which authorizes temporary admission into the United States. Work with your school without delay to submit the proper documentation required by the Form I-515A. Failing to comply with a Form I-515A will result in the termination of your status. Read SEVP’s Form I-515A Noncompliance Termination procedure to ensure you understand how to properly respond and maintain your status.
If the CBP officer admits you into the country, you will be given a Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record.” This form shows that you have been legally admitted into the United States, the class of admission and your authorized period of stay. It is very important that the information on the record is correct. Inconsistencies between the information on the Form I-94 and SEVIS records can reduce the chances of a successful systems interface and can result in denial of benefits or difficulty re-entering the country.
You have 30 days to enter the country before your official program start date, as listed on your Form I-20. If you do not report to your school by your program start date, your DSO may terminate your SEVIS record. We suggest that you contact your school immediately once you enter the country so that there is no question of your arrival.
If you cannot enter the United States for the term listed on your Form I-20, contact your school officials as soon as possible so that they can update your record so your plans are accurately reflected in SEVIS.
As an F or M student, you will often hear the phrase “maintaining status.” Maintaining your status means that you are fulfilling the purpose for why the U.S. Department of State issued you your visa and following the regulations associated with that purpose. Remember, a student visa is a travel document you receive from a U.S. consulate or embassy before you enter the United States. Your student status is what you must maintain after you are granted entrance into the United States. Learn more about the rules you must follow by talking to your DSO and reviewing the Maintaining Status page on Study in the States.
While studying in the United States, you may be eligible to apply for certain benefits. These student benefits are not granted by SEVP and require students to apply to other government agencies to receive them. The benefits you are eligible for will depend on your student status. Visit the following pages to learn more about potential student benefits:
As a note, most employment and training opportunities require authorization from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). For more information, visit the Employment page on ICE.gov.
If you are having an immediate problem and need assistance quickly, please speak with your DSO or responsible officer. If that person cannot help you, contact the SEVP Response Center at 1-703-603-3400 or at SEVP@ice.dhs.gov.
Once you have completed your program and fulfilled your purpose for coming to the United States, you may have a number of options. These include changing your status, applying for training, transferring to another SEVP-certified school or leaving the country.
Please note there are restrictions that apply to M-1 students regarding transferring and changing status. Talk to your DSO to understand what your options are.
If after your program is complete you do not qualify to stay in the country, or chose to depart, please be advised:
You can also visit USCIS to learn about naturalization and the path to U.S. citizenship.

Federal Policies on Immigrant Students,"The United States establishes policies at the federal level that impact higher education access, degree completion, and post-graduate career prospects for DACA and undocumented, international, and other immigrant students. This page summarizes and tracks key federal policies, proposed legislation, and administrative actions impacting these communities. 
Visit our states page to learn more about state-level policies.
There are currently more than 408,000 undocumented students enrolled in postsecondary education, representing about 1.9 percent of all postsecondary students.
While most undocumented students pursuing postsecondary education do not have DACA, the vast majority, accounting for three out of four undocumented students, came to the U.S. at a young age. Without U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, these students face significant barriers to higher education.
Currently, children who arrive with a parent who has an H-1B high skill visa or certain other nonimmigrant visas are able to maintain their legal status as the visa holder’s dependent until the age of 21. However, if parents do not secure a green card before the dependent reaches 21, these children “age out” of their dependent status and must leave the United States, even if their parent has a DHS-approved green card petition. Young people in this situation have referred to themselves as “Documented Dreamers.”
Documented Dreamers and undocumented students with and without DACA are unable to access federal financial aid. In addition, many states do not allow undocumented students to pay more affordable in-state tuition rates and preclude them from accessing in-state financial aid. These barriers can significantly impact students’ ability to pursue higher education, as well as their post-graduate employment opportunities. 
The sections below highlight current policies that impact higher education access, degree completion, and post-graduate career prospects for undocumented students, including DACA recipients.
DACA is a deferred action policy implemented by the Obama administration in June 2012. DACA protects certain undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, providing two-year work permits and protection from deportation. DACA is temporary and can be revoked by the federal government. It does not provide a path to citizenship.
Less than half of the 408,000 undocumented students currently enrolled in higher education are eligible for or currently benefit from DACA. Projections for undocumented students graduating from high school are even smaller: while nearly 100,000 undocumented students are graduating high school annually, only a quarter of them are estimated to be eligible for DACA. Many of these students arrived in the United States as children and meet the same criteria as current DACA recipients. 
January 20, 2021. The Biden administration issues Preserving and Fortifying Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a new memorandum that directed the DHS Secretary to “fortify and protect” DACA. The issuance of this memorandum signals the start of official rollbacks of the Trump administration’s efforts to end DACA. 
September 28, 2021. The Biden administration issues a new regulation to formally meet the goals of the memorandum. The administration begins the notice and comment process to address criticisms that the first memo did not comply with the Administrative Procedures Act, the formal process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations. 
August 30, 2022. DHS issues the final regulation.
October 31, 2022. The rule becomes effective. 
February 14, 2023.  USCIS issues new guidance requiring adjudicators to make it possible for individuals to maintain their dependent status for longer periods of time. Under the provisions of this guidance, individuals who previously aged out are potentially able to reopen past denials by filing a Notice of Appeal or Motion.
Litigation against DACA began in 2018 and is currently ongoing. The timeline below outlines key moments over the last several years impacting the program’s future. 
May 1, 2018. Seven states file a lawsuit against the program, arguing that the Department of Homeland Security does not have the authority to grant the protections provided in the program. 
July 16, 2021. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas agrees and vacates the original memo that created the program.
September 10, 2021. The Biden administration appeals the decision to the Fifth Circuit of the Court of Appeals. New DACA regulation is released several weeks later.
October 5, 2022. The Fifth Circuit rules that DACA’s creation violated the Administrative Procedures Act and remands the case to the U.S. District Court for review. Although the court preserved the deportation protections and employment authorizations for current DACA recipients and permitted DHS to process renewals, it prohibited the agency from receiving new applications. 
October 14, 2022. The court maintains the same conditions for the program and asks the administration to provide additional information in order to make a final ruling. 
February 1, 2023. The same group of states escalates its efforts to end the program by filing a motion pressing the U.S. District Court overseeing the litigation to determine whether the 2022 DACA rule is also unlawful and to block the government from approving renewal applications two years after a decision is made.
September 13, 2023. Judge Hanen of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas finds the 2022 DACA regulation unlawful, writing that it was not materially different from the 2012 DACA memorandum he and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals previously found to be unlawful on both procedural and substantive grounds. Judge Hanen stays the order terminating DACA as to existing recipients, allowing DHS to continue to process renewals. 
November 9, 2023. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) files a notice of appeal, arguing that the states failed to prove injury from DACA’s implementation and that the rule is a lawful exercise of presidential discretion and requesting that the Fifth Circuit review Hanen’s ruling.  
What’s next? The case now goes back to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The briefing stage will take place in early 2024, followed by oral arguments. The decision by the Fifth Circuit could be issued in the summer or fall of 2024. It is widely expected that the Fifth Circuit will uphold Judge Hanen’s ruling that the DACA program is unlawful and that the case will then be appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 bars the provision of “state and local public benefits,” including “postsecondary benefits,” for “non-qualified aliens” unless the state passes an affirmative law making them explicitly eligible. Some courts view financial aid, in-state tuition, and even admission as public benefits. Approximately 23 states and D.C. offer in-state tuition to undocumented students. 
In light of this restriction, states – through legislation, regulations, or education board policies – must affirmatively expand access to postsecondary benefits for most immigrant students. Before 1996, all immigrants were generally eligible for postsecondary benefits. However, since 1996, only states that have enacted affirmative policies on postsecondary benefits offer these benefits to immigrant students. 
Legislative Recommendations Regarding Immigrant Students, Higher Education Access, Federal Financial Aid, and Professional and Occupational Licensure (Presidents’ Alliance, 2021)
Higher Ed Components of Key Immigration Legislation Impacting Undocumented Students (Presidents’ Alliance, 2021).
PRWORA also bars the provision of “state and local public benefits,” including “professional, commercial, and business licenses” (also known as “occupational licenses”) for “non-qualified aliens” unless the state passes an affirmative law making them explicitly eligible.
Over 1,100 different occupations require a license and approximately 25 percent of all workers nationwide are required to obtain a license to work in their occupations. Licensure is essential for many graduates from higher education to utilize their degree. Without access to licensure, individuals may not be able to fully leverage their education, which can significantly impact their economic stability in the United States.

Leaving Money on the Table: The Persistence of Brain Waste among College-Educated Immigrants (Migration Policy Institute (MPI), 2021). 
The Skills and Economic Outcomes of Immigrant and U.S.-Born College Graduates (Migration Policy Institute (MPI), 2022).
Section 505 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRAIRA) bars states from providing “postsecondary education benefits” to those who are “not lawfully present” based on in-state residency unless all citizens of the U.S. are eligible for those benefits regardless of state residency.
Approximately 23 states and D.C. offer in-state tuition on a variety of non-residency grounds (e.g., high school graduation in the state or similar), thereby overcoming the section 505 prohibition. Legal challenges to such programs, including an existing legal challenge in Texas, still often cite section 505. The threat that courts will interpret section 505 in more restrictive ways remains in the coming years, potentially putting these in-state tuition laws at risk.
Legislative Recommendations Regarding Immigrant Students, Higher Education Access, Federal Financial Aid, and Professional and Occupational Licensure (Presidents’ Alliance, 2021)
The REAL ID Act imposes standards on identification documents that the federal government will accept for purposes of identification, most notably boarding commercial aircraft.
The deadline for REAL ID enforcement has been extended to May 7, 2025, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
These standards may interfere with immigrant and international students’ ability to enroll and/or participate in their education, particularly in terms of being able to travel to the location of their higher education. While 18 states and D.C. provide undocumented individuals with access to driver licenses, these licenses are usually not REAL ID-compliant.
In February 2023, Senators Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) and Lindsay Graham (R-South Carolina) introduced the Dream Act of 2023 (S. 365). Under the bill, an immigrant can obtain permanent relief if they:
Under the Dream Act of 2021, the prior iteration of this bill, upwards of 1.7 million DACA recipients and other Dreamers would have been eligible for lawful permanent resident (LPR) status. Under the Dream Act of 2023, close to three million undocumented youth and young adults would be potential beneficiaries. Nearly one million people could become eligible if they enroll in school. The bill would also repeal barriers for states seeking to offer in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants.
H.R.6 – The American Dream and Promise Act, was introduced by Representative Sylvia Garcia (D-TX) in June 2023. 
Through this bill, undocumented youth who came to the U.S. as minors would become eligible for conditional permanent resident status for ten years if they:
To qualify, applicants must demonstrate continuous presence in the United States since January 1, 2021, pass a background check, and enroll in or complete an educational program. 
This bill would also restrict states from providing higher education benefits to undocumented students unless those benefits are also made available to all U.S. nationals without regard to residency in the state.
H.R.3194 – the U.S. Citizenship Act was introduced in the House in May 2023 by Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-CA).  This bill seeks to establish a new “lawful prospective immigrant” status for noncitizens who have been in the United States since January 1, 2021 and pass a background check.
Under this bill certain non-citizens would be eligible for permanent resident status if they:
Eligible Dreamers, TPS recipients, and agricultural workers would be immediately eligible for green cards, as would their spouses and children. Individuals who qualify for lawful prospective immigrant status under this bill may be able to apply for permanent resident status after five years.  
This bill also seeks to address the root causes of migration, create safe and legal channels for migration, modernize the border, and protect border communities. Key provisions include: 
H.R. 3599 – the Dignity for Immigrants while Guarding our Nation to Ignite and Deliver the American Dream Act of 2023 (the DIGNIDAD (Dignity) Act), presents opportunities for removal deferral for eligible noncitizens and increases funding for activities related to border security.
Dignity status would grant undocumented people who meet eligibility criteria permanently renewable legal status, along with work and travel authority. 
To participate in the program, Dignity beneficiaries must: 
The Dignity Act addresses a variety of other topics, including: 
among others. 
The SUCCEED Act (S.1852) authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to cancel the removal of undocumented migrants who entered the United States as children and grant them conditional permanent resident status if they:
To qualify, applicants cannot have a criminal history and must demonstrate good moral character, educational attainment and/or military service, and compliance with tax responsibilities. The bill would allow undocumented individuals to apply for naturalization five years after adjustment to lawful permanent resident status and to apply for lawful permanent residence after 10 years of conditional status. 
In order to provide relief for “Documented Dreamers,” a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced the America’s Cultivation of Hope and Inclusion for Long-term Dependents Raised and Educated Natively Act of 2021 (H.R. 4331, or the America’s CHILDREN Act. This act allows the children of temporary work visa holders who graduated from U.S. institutions of higher education and meet other requirements the ability to directly apply for a green card. Although Congress did not pass this bill, there were discussions to add similar language in the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act as an amendment for the bill.
The sections below highlight current policies that shape international students’ prospects for staying and working in the United States. 
The U.S. does not currently have a national strategy to attract, welcome, and retain international students, although the Biden-Harris administration did release a Joint Statement of Principles to guide agencies in their work related to international education. As other countries are proactively implementing politics to attract and retain the best and brightest from around the world, the White House should develop and implement a coordinated U.S. International Education strategy, and each agency should set clear goals and strategies for how to attract, support and retain a greater diversity of international students pursuing their degrees and work opportunities in the United States.
Under current federal policies, international students enrolling at colleges and universities usually enter the U.S. on F-1 visas, which are, single-intent “non-immigrant” visas. Universities and colleges have been working hard to stem the decline in international student enrollments, but without a national recruitment and retention strategy, which would enable international students to more easily stay and work in the U.S. after they graduate, the U.S. is at a disadvantage with other competitor countries. 
International (or foreign) students applying for F-1 visas to study at U.S. colleges and universities arrive in the country as “nonimmigrants,” which means that international students must show that they intend to enter the U.S. “temporarily and solely for the purpose of pursuing such a course of study.” By assuming all F-1 students will be “non-immigrants,” current law does not permit individuals who are being screened for a student visa or when entering the U.S. to communicate an interest in transferring to another legal status or staying in the U.S. to build their career after the completion of their degree. 
In contrast, dual intent is an immigration law concept that allows a person to enter the United States with “nonimmigrant intent” (“I intend to leave the United States when my visa term is up”) while also maintaining the possibility of staying (“While in the United States, I also want to try to qualify for a more permanent status”). Dual intent is currently available in other nonimmigrant categories such as specialty workers (H-1B) and intracompany transferees (L-1).
From a higher education perspective, expanding dual intent for full time international students pursuing a U.S. degree would increase the attractiveness of the U.S. as a destination for talented international students in the competitive global marketplace, better match the expectations of many prospective and current international students, and align with the country’s economic and national interests. In contrast to countries such as Canada, the U.S. also does not have a proper entrepreneur visa that would allow foreign students to start their own firms, a pathway that largely does not exist for H-1B holders since they must work for a sponsoring employer at a designated worksite.
Next steps: Although the Biden Administration has made progress in clarifying how consular officers should interpret non-immigrant intent for students, Congressional legislation is needed that would 1) update INA language to remove the requirement to maintain a foreign residence abroad for F visa applicants, and 2) expand the list of visas eligible for dual intent to include F-1s.
Optional Practical Training (OPT) is an experiential learning opportunity and work program available to international students. International students may participate in “pre-completion” OPT while enrolled or “post-completion” OPT, upon the completion of their studies. OPT offers temporary employment authorization to international students in the United States, allowing eligible students and recent graduates to gain valuable work experience within their field of study. Standard OPT is for 12 months. STEM OPT offers eligible students with STEM degrees to apply for a 24-month extension.
OPT/STEM OPT are key channels through which international students contribute to American higher education, innovation, scientific discovery, and economic growth. See Presidents’ Alliance post on OPT.

The H-1B visa program allows employers to contract non-citizens for high-skilled positions for a three-year term with the potential to renew this status for another three-year period. The program maintains 65,000 new visas each fiscal year, with an additional 20,000 visas available for non-citizens with a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. institution of higher education. The program also exempts institutions of higher education and affiliated nonprofit organizations from the H-1B cap. For those employers subject to the H-1B cap, the program distributes visas every year through a lottery that randomly selects employers that sponsored non-citizens for a H-1B visa or requested an extension of H-1B status for existing beneficiaries.
The H-1B program serves as one of the primary pathways for international alumni and professionals to stay and work in the U.S., and contribute to innovation, research, and the economy .
DHS has the authority to designate countries experiencing severe economic hardship due to humanitarian concerns for Special Student Relief (SSR), which suspends certain regulatory requirements for F-1 students from these countries. SSR can suspend restrictions related to on- and off-campus employment and alter the full course of study requirements for eligible F-1 students by permitting a reduced course load.
The Biden administration has issued an increased number of SSR designations in recent years for countries facing significant conflicts or humanitarian disasters. A chart with current SSR designations can be found below.
Special Student Relief Designations and Decision Dates (Chart Regularly Updated) (TPS-DED AAC, 2022).
The sections below highlight current policies that impact higher education access, degree completion, and post-graduate career prospects for international students and scholars.
The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) provides protections to individuals who have fled their countries due to “a well-founded fear of persecution for their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.” The U.S. government selects and vets individuals located overseas to receive protection and come live in the United States. Once the United States selects individuals for resettlement, the government works with non-governmental organizations to integrate refugees into communities across the country. The president in consultation with congress sets the number of refugees the country will receive each year before October 1.
Over 100 million people are displaced worldwide, including 32.5 million refugees as of the end of mid-2022. Of these, only six percent of college-eligible refugees can access higher education. UNHCR has set a goal of fifteen percent of eligible refugees accessing higher education by 2030.
U.S. colleges and universities can and should help reach that goal. However, it is very difficult for refugee students to enter the U.S. as international students since the F-1 visa’s requirement does not match the reality of most refugee students. F-1 applicants must demonstrate their intention to enter the U.S. “temporarily and solely for the purpose” of their academic program and they cannot communicate an interest in transferring to another legal status. If the U.S. pilots a university sponsorship program for refugee students, this can serve as a crucial step toward expanding access to U.S. higher education for refugee students.
Refugees also face other obstacles to accessing higher education, including learning local languages and terms used in academic settings, understanding the new country’s higher education systems, financing their education in the United States, getting institutions to recognize their academic and professional credentials, and integrating into higher education institutions and on-campus life.
Although President Biden has made public commitments to resettle more refugees after several years where the Trump administration significantly lowered these numbers, the administration has not fulfilled them. On May 3, 2021, the administration announced it would raise the refugee cap from the 15,000 individuals the Trump administration set for Fiscal Year 2021 – the lowest point since the program’s inception in 1980 – to 62,500, a move that followed the release of a February 2021 executive order to enhance and rebuild the refugee system. While the administration stated it increased the cap due to emerging refugee emergencies around the world, the United States only received 11,411 individuals that year.
The same pattern occurred for Fiscal Year 2022. On October 8, 2021, the administration announced it would accept 125,000 refugees for Fiscal Year 2022. On September 8, 2022, the administration reported it would only receive between 23,000 to 25,000 individuals, an outcome that has been attributed to the significant resources needed to assist with the reception of Afghans and Ukrainians fleeing violence in their countries. In 2021, the U.S. evacuated 76,000 Afghans and charged the refugee resettlement agencies with providing resettlement services through the Afghan Placement & Assistance (APA) program. Furthermore, over 38,000 have arrived in the U.S. from Ukraine through the Uniting for Ukraine program and another 75,000 are approved for travel. Nevertheless, the administration committed to resettling the same number of individuals for Fiscal Year 2023 on September 27, 2022.
The Biden administration has expanded the ability of private individuals in the United States to assist and resettle refugees and other displaced individuals. In October 2021, the administration introduced the Sponsor Circle for Afghans, a program that allowed a group of individuals to provide financial support for Afghans who were evacuated to the United States during the U.S. Withdrawal from Afghanistan. In January 2023, the administration unveiled the Welcome Corps, which will allow individuals and organizations like universities to support the arrival of refugees admitted through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. The program will eventually allow these entities to refer individuals for admission through the USRAP and assist with their reception. The administration will announce a similar program for higher education institutions in 2023.
Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) are forms of humanitarian protection that provide work permits and protection from deportation for noncitizens who cannot be safely returned to their home country. Over 300,000 individuals are protected under TPS and over 200,000 individuals are protected under DED. 
TPS holders represent students, staff, and faculty at many higher education institutions. TPS also provides the security and financial stability through work permits for individuals to be able to attend and complete their higher education.
Litigation against the Trump administration’s decision to end TPS for most recipients in 2018 may have failed to produce lasting protection for these groups. After President Biden came into office in January 2021, the administration aimed to settle the litigation through a series of negotiations with the plaintiffs’ attorneys, a move that saw it pause the Trump administration’s efforts to challenge these cases in the courts.
On October 27, 2022, however, these talks collapsed after both sides failed to reach an agreement on the scope of protection for these individuals. This development means approximately 337,000 TPS recipients from El Salvador, Nicaragua, Nepal, and Honduras may lose their status depending on whether the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which rejected a lower court ruling against the decision in September 2020, accepts the plaintiffs’ request to rehear the case with the full roster of judges or deny this request. On February 11, 2023, the 9th Circuit announced it would hear the cases with the full roster of judges.
In response to this situation, the Biden administration issued a Federal Register Notice on November 10, 2022 stating that these TPS recipients will retain their status while the preliminary injunction against the decision to end TPS for these groups remains in place. DHS also automatically extended the Employment Authorization Documents and other TPS-related documents for this group through June 30, 2024.
Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure Designations and Decision Dates (Chart Regularly Updated) and Resources (TPS-DED AAC, 2022).
The H-4 work authorization program, introduced in 2015 through executive action, allows certain spouses of H-1B recipients to receive work authorization. Although all spouses of H visa holders must have an H-4 visa to enter the United States, the visa does not provide them with an employment authorization document to legally work in the country. H-4 visa holders can access this benefit to work for any employer if their H-1B spouses have received approval for employment-based green cards but continue to wait for a green card to become available.
H-4 dependents who are children of H-1B visa holders are not eligible to receive work authorization employment.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is issuing policy guidance regarding the F and M student nonimmigrant classifications, including the agency’s role in adjudicating applications for employment authorization, change of status, extension of stay, and reinstatement of status for these students and their dependents in the United States.
This guidance consolidates existing policy. USCIS expects that this will provide welcome clarity to international students and U.S. educational institutions on a wealth of topics, including eligibility requirements, school transfers, practical training, and on- and off-campus employment.
For example, the guidance clarifies that F and M students must have a foreign residence that they do not intend to abandon, but that such students may be the beneficiary of a permanent labor certification application or immigrant visa petition and may still be able to demonstrate their intention to depart after a temporary period of stay.
In addition, the guidance specifies how F students seeking an extension of optional practical training (OPT) based on their degree in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field may be employed by startup companies, as long as the employer adheres to the training plan requirements, remains in good standing with E-Verify, and provides compensation commensurate to that provided to similarly situated U.S. workers, among other requirements.
The nonimmigrant academic student (F-1) classification allows a noncitizen to enter the United States as a full-time student at a college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution, or in a language training program. The nonimmigrant vocational student (M-1) classification includes students in established vocational or other recognized nonacademic programs, other than language training programs.
For more information about the USCIS guidance, see the Policy Alert (PDF, 312.06 KB) and Volume 2, Part F of the Policy Manual. For more information about the role of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in administering these nonimmigrant student programs, see the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS).

New USCIS Policies for International Students & Companies,"Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has updated its policy guidance for F and M student visas, consolidating various rules into one clear document to reduce confusion and increase transparency for students and businesses. This includes clarifications on maintaining foreign residence while pursuing permanent residency, and new options for F-1 STEM students to work with startups during their Optional Practical Training (OPT) extensions.
The guidance addresses key areas such as employment authorization, change of status, extension of stay, and reinstatement of status for F and M students and their dependents in the United States.
The updated guidance emphasizes that F and M students must maintain a foreign residence and not intend to permanently abandon their home country.
Despite this, the policy now allows students to apply for permanent residency through green cards in the U.S. It’s crucial for students to demonstrate their intention to return to their home country after their temporary stay in the U.S., even as they explore long-term options.
For F-1 students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, the policy update is particularly noteworthy. It offers an extension of Optional Practical Training (OPT) for those seeking employment opportunities with startup companies.
The startups must comply with specific requirements: they need to adhere to the outlined training plans, be in good standing with E-Verify, and provide compensation that is on par with similarly situated U.S. workers. This creates new employment opportunities but also requires students and their employers to be vigilant about meeting these conditions.
USCIS has provided detailed explanations regarding the maintenance of student status. This includes comprehensive guidance on transferring schools, exploring different employment options while on a student visa, and the procedures for applying for various benefits.
The clearer guidelines help students understand their responsibilities and rights under their visa status. However, it also means that students need to be more proactive in ensuring their activities and employment align with these updated rules to maintain their legal status in the U.S.
While the policy update offers greater flexibility and opens up new avenues, it’s essential for students to plan their future in the U.S. with these regulations in mind.
Whether it’s considering long-term residency or seeking employment post-graduation, students should factor in these updated guidelines in their decision-making process.
IMPORTANT: With these changes, the onus is on the students to stay informed and compliant with the updated policies. This involves regularly checking for any new updates or changes in immigration policies that might affect their status.

“Understanding and adapting to the USCIS’s new policy guidance is crucial for employers seeking to tap into the rich pool of international talent. This guidance not only opens up new avenues for hiring bright minds, especially in the STEM fields, but also brings a responsibility to ensure compliance with the nuanced requirements,” said Hendrik Pretorius, Immigration Attorney and Director of Account Management at Boundless. “As companies navigate these changes, it’s important to strike a balance between leveraging global talent and adhering to the intricate landscape of immigration policies. Proactive engagement and informed strategies will be key to harnessing the potential of international students in a way that benefits both the students and the growth of our companies.”
USCIS’s revised policy guidance is a pivotal development for both F and M international students and U.S. employers. It aims to simplify and clarify the complexities of student visa categories, providing a clearer path for students pursuing education and career opportunities in the United States. For students, it opens doors to new opportunities, particularly in STEM fields, and delineates the conditions under which they can pursue permanent residency while on a student visa. Employers stand to benefit from a broader pool of international talent, especially in specialized STEM areas, with the added responsibility of ensuring compliance with the specific requirements of the OPT program. This guidance symbolizes a stride towards a more integrated and supportive framework for international students and the companies that seek to employ them, fostering an environment of growth, innovation, and mutual benefit. As we navigate these changes, the importance of staying informed, adhering to legal requirements, and seeking expert advice cannot be overstated, ensuring that the potential of these policies is fully realized for the enrichment of both international students and the American workforce.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.
While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa.  However, once you depart the United States you must apply for a new visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.

There is no guarantee you will be issued a visa. Do not make final travel plans or buy tickets until you have a visa.
For information about working in the United States during your study, review Students and Employment and Form I-765 Work Authorization Instructions on the USCIS website.
If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

Visa and Immigration Policy: Reform for a System that Works,"NAFSA advocates for creating a comprehensive visa and immigration process that reflects our values as a welcoming and inclusive nation, helps to attract the world’s brightest students, meets the needs for progress and competitiveness, and recognizes our global interconnectivity.
International students, scholars, and their families are assets to academic and scientific innovation, public diplomacy, economic vitality, national security, and global leadership. By making it difficult for international students and scholars to enter the country, travel while here, and engage in experiential learning or collaborate on cutting-edge research, we cripple our ability to compete for global talent, risk harming our national and economic security, and deprive U.S. students and institutions of the diverse and enriching contributions international students and scholars bring to our campuses.
NAFSA recommendations span both the executive and legislative branches of federal government, requesting executive and agency-level implementation or congressional action
The following are bills introduced during the 118th Congress that include positive provisions for international students and scholars. Each bill is unlikely to pass on its own during this Congress, but provisions from each may be incorporated into other bills. NAFSA will advocate for international student provisions to be included in “must pass” bills as they make their way through the legislative process.
Whether you are looking for the latest news or job updates or simply want to keep a finger on the pulse of the international education community, NAFSA has a number of easy ways to stay updated—all in your preferred social media platform.

USCIS Issues New Guidance on F and M Student Visa ...,"Quick Hits
The updated policy guidance for F and M student classifications consolidates and clarifies existing policy into one cohesive document in an effort to provide clarity to international students and U.S. educational institutions. The guidance covers topics including the agency’s role in adjudicating applications for employment authorization, change of status, extension of stay, and reinstatement of status for students and their dependents in the United States.
In order to be eligible for F and M student classifications, students must intend to depart from the United States following their temporary periods of stay, typically following the end of the degree program and any period of practical training. Students must maintain a foreign residence that they do not intend to abandon. Notably, the policy guidance clarifies that F and M students may be the beneficiary of a permanent labor certification application or immigrant visa petition and still be able to demonstrate their intent to depart after a temporary period of stay. Having a pending or approved labor certification application or immigrant visa petition will not necessarily impact a student’s eligibility for these classifications. USCIS officers will consider all facts when determining if a student has demonstrated eligibility.
In the employment context, the guidance clarifies that an F-1 student seeking the two-year science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) optional practical training (OPT) extension may be employed by a start-up business provided that the start-up adheres to the regulatory requirements, including complying with training plan requirements and maintaining good standing with E-Verify. The guidance also clarifies that alternative compensation may be permitted during the STEM OPT extension as long as the F-1 student can demonstrate “they are a bona fide employee and that their compensation … is commensurate with the compensation provided to other similarly situated U.S. workers.”
Key Takeaways
The policy guidance offers new clarity for students and U.S. educational institutions with regard to the considerations made by officers when determining eligibility for F and M student classifications and when assessing options for employment.

U.S. State Policies on DACA & Undocumented Students,"The U.S. has a rich legacy of immigrant-origin and international students contributing to the academic, social, and economic life of higher education communities across the country. Today, one out of every three students in higher education is a first or second-generation immigrant or international student.
The Portal highlights how 24 states and D.C. provide in-state tuition to the states’ undocumented students. Of those states, 18 and D.C. (“Comprehensive Access”) also provide access to state financial aid. Massachusetts, which just passed in-state tuition for undocumented students, brings the number of states with access to in-state tuition to 24.
Four states provide undocumented students with access to in-state tuition in some but not all universities, 5 states provide access to in-state tuition only to DACA recipients, 8 states and P.R do not have known policies, and 9 states actively block access to in-state tuition for undocumented students, including 3 states which prevent undocumented students from enrolling in all or some public colleges.

The Higher Ed Immigration Portal measures where states are situated on equity and access to higher education, degree completion, and career prospects for DACA and undocumented students.
The U.S. is home to more than 408,000 undocumented students, including DACA recipients, in higher education. Each state implements its own policies in terms of providing access to in-state tuition and state financial aid to the state’s undocumented residents.
The Portal analyzes in-state tuition and state financial aid policies across all 50 states and D.C. to measure and compare the inclusivity and effectiveness of the policies. Policies that provide tuition and state financial aid equity generally expand access to higher education and help fuel the state’s economy.
The Portal analyzes and measures a state’s in-state tuition and state financial aid policies for undocumented students to assign each state to one of the following seven classifications.
Key Point: Most undocumented students in the U.S. live in Comprehensive Access or Accessible states, but a significant percentage still face immigration-related barriers to higher education.
The Portal scans professional and occupational licensure policies across all 50 states and D.C. to measure and compare the inclusivity and effectiveness of the policies. Policies that provide individuals with access to professional, commercial, and business licenses, regardless of their immigration status, generally aid the state’s economy.
The Portal analyzes and measures a state’s professional and occupational licensure policies for undocumented immigrants to assign each state to one of the following five classifications.
TheDream.Us and Immigrant Finance put together resource guides of state professional/occupational licensure requirements and state business and tax registration requirements for immigrants. The guides are based on outreach to the state’s specific licensing boards and each state’s business and tax agencies from April 2023 to July 2023 and are subject to change. The guides include an interactive table of contents. You can access the information for any state by clicking on the state you wish to learn more about on the table of contents. 
The professional/occupation licensure requirements guide provides licensing information for 11 different professions
(1) Nursing (Registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs); 
(2) Physician’s Assistant; 
(3) Counseling (i.e. Associate Licensed Counselor ALC), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC);
 (4) Therapy/Psychology (Psychologist, Psychological Technician); 
(5) Clinical Lab Technician; 
(6) Dentistry/dental assistant/dental hygienist; 
(7) Education (Educator Certification); 
(8) Law (License to Practice Law); 
(9) Accounting (CPA): 
(10) Social Work (LBSW, LMSW, LCSW, LCSW-C); 
(11) Engineering (Professional Engineer).
You can find the guide for professional/occupational licensure requirements here and the guide for state business and tax registration requirements here or by clicking on the state you’re interested in to learn more about Professional & Occupational Licensure under the Professional & Occupational Licensure section.  
 
The Portal analyzes driver license and state identification policies across all 50 states and D.C. to measure and compare the policies. Policies that provide individuals access to driver licenses and state identification cards, regardless of their immigration status, help expand mobility and increase safety in the state’s roads.
The Portal analyzes and measures a state’s driver license policies for undocumented immigrants to assign each state to one of the following two classifications.
A growing number of private colleges and universities in the U.S. consider undocumented students to be domestic students for the purposes of admission and financial aid. Many colleges and universities have also expanded access to specific institutional funds, external scholarships or other donor funds to support undocumented students.
You can see a list of top 30 U.S. colleges and universities. The overwhelming majority have expanded financial aid equity to undocumented students comparable to other domestic students.
This section provides an overview of the top states in the number of undocumented, first and second-generation immigrant, and international students enrolled in higher education.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.
While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa.  However, once you depart the United States you must apply for a new visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.

For information about working in the United States during your study, review Students and Employment and Form I-765 Work Authorization Instructions on the USCIS website.
If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.
Additional resources for Canadian visitors to the United States can be found on the U.S. Embassy and Consulate websites in Canada.

Applying for the F-1 Student Visa,"You must apply for your visa well in advance of your arrival, as it can in some instances take several weeks and occasionally longer, to obtain the F-1 student visa.
Although the U.S. Department of State states that F-1 student visas can be issued up to 365 days in advance of the program start date, OISS can only start the process to issue your immigration document after you accept your offer of admission and we receive your student record from your Yale school, which usually does not happen until March in most cases. Check the website of the consulate where you will apply for a visa for detailed instructions.
Before you begin the visa application process, you must have the following documents:
This will be sent to you in the mail from Yale after you have been admitted. Your I-20 is required when applying for an F-1 student visa at an American embassy or consulate and for entry into the United States. This I-20 has been produced by Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and is an acknowledgement that your record is in the SEVIS system. The form includes your SEVIS ID number, which is the number in the upper corner above the bar code, (usually starts with an N).
Thoroughly review your I-20 to make sure all of the information is correct. Sign the form at the bottom of page 1. If you have any questions, please contact your OISS adviser.
All new students coming in F-1 status must pay a one-time SEVIS fee prior to applying for your visa, and must submit the SEVIS fee receipt as part of their application. You can find instructions about paying the fee on this page. If you are renewing your F-1 visa it is recommended that you have proof of SEVIS fee payment, even though it does not have to be paid again. You can view and print the receipt by clicking “Check I-901 Status” at the top of this page.
If you have family members traveling with you in F-2 status, Yale will mail an I-20 for their use. Each F-2 dependent should have their own I-20 form. Each F-2 dependent I-20 is issued their own SEVIS number but an additional SEVIS fee does not need to be paid for a dependent.
The first step in applying for a U.S. visa is the online application DS-160.
Access the DS-160 application at the Consular Electronic Application Center website.
Watch an overview of the online application process.
Read Frequently Asked Questions about the DS-160.
Below are suggested answers you are welcome to use when you fill out this form. Please be aware that you are ultimately responsible for the accuracy of information you provide in this form.

List your primary source of funding as it appears on your I-20/DS-2019.
The next step in applying for a U.S. visa is making an appointment at your closest U.S. embassy or consulate. It is generally recommended that you apply for a visa in your home country rather than a third country if possible.
At this appointment you will need to present the following documents:
Check the website of the U.S. consulate/embassy where you are applying to see if there are other requirements.
An application fee and an interview will also be required. There have been (and continue to be) changes in the visa application process and these changes are usually reflected on the consular websites.
Find the nearest U.S. Consulate or Embassy.
Find the visa appointment wait times at your local consulate.
Attend your scheduled visa interview at your U.S. embassy or consulate. Here are 10 points to remember when applying for a non-immigrant visa.
Check the visa in your passport to make sure that all the information on it is correct. If the information is not correct it can only be changed at the embassy or consulate that issued your visa.
Your I-20 should be returned to you. You will need it to enter the U.S.
When applying for your student visa, pay careful attention to the following.
You may enter the U.S. no more than 30 days prior to the starting date noted on the I-20 form. If you try to enter the U.S. more than 30 days before this starting date, you may not be permitted to enter the U.S.
You must pay particular attention to the starting date noted on your I-20 form, as you must enter the U.S. by this date. If you cannot enter the U.S. by this date, please get in touch with OISS about the process for changing your start date.
The expiration date on your visa may not match the end date of your degree program. If your visa expires before you complete your degree program, you will apply for a new visa on your first trip outside the U.S. after your current visa expires.
If the U.S. consulate has any questions regarding your studies at Yale, please contact OISS. If your visa application is delayed or denied for any reason, please email your OISS adviser immediately. Safe travels and we look forward to meeting you when you arrive in New Haven!

"F-1 Visas for International Students: Requirements, Rules ...","Get ready to study abroad in America with our step-by-step guide to F-1 visa rules. 
Students wishing to study in the United States need to learn about the F-1 student visa application process. There are more than one million international students currently studying abroad in the USA, and with some preparation and guidance, you can join them. To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. The I-20 form provided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with your F-1 visa after graduation.
Have questions about the student visa process? Attend an upcoming Shorelight webinar > 
There are several F-1 visa rules to keep in mind if you plan to apply for a F-1 student visa. You must meet these requirements for your application to be accepted:
Institution certification—The college or the university where you plan to study needs to be approved by SEVP Immigration & Customs Enforcement.
Full-time enrollment—You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution while your academic term is in session.
English language proficiency—You must meet the required English language proficiency score of the institution you are attending or be enrolled in courses that will help you improve your English proficiency.
Sufficient funding—You must prove you have sufficient funds available to finance your studies and living expenses while in the US.
Valid passport—Your passport should be valid for US travel for at least six months after your program completion date.
Home country residency—You are required to have a residence in your home country to return to following the completion of your degree.

Before you begin your F-1 visa application, you must take the following steps:
Get accepted by a SEVP-certified institution before submitting your visa application. When you are accepted, you will receive your I-20 form, which you will need to apply for your F-1 visa.
Pay your SEVIS fee.
Complete your DS-160 visa application.
Schedule your visa interview.
Attend your visa interview.
If you are applying for a F-1 visa from India, Shorelight’s F-1 visa for Indian students guide is for you.
Once these steps are completed, you will be ready to complete and submit your F-1 student visa application. 
1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US government’s way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education. 
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay. 
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials. 
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., like getting a US driver’s license). 
Helpful resources: Confirm your US university is a SEVP-accredited institution 
Keep your Shorelight enrollment advisor updated through every step of the visa process – when you submit your application, schedule your visa interview, and, of course, when your visa application is approved.
2. Pay Your SEVIS Fee
The total cost for your F-1 student visa will be approximately $510, which includes the cost of the visa itself, plus SEVIS processing and maintenance fees. 
Requirements: Your I-20
Cost: $350 
Where to apply: Payment portal for your SEVIS fee
Make sure to save the I-901 SEVIS fee receipt. You will need it for your visa interview. 
3. Complete Your DS-160 Visa Application
Your DS-160 is your visa application. All prospective international students must complete a DS-160 to receive an F-1 visa. 
Requirements: Your I-20, passport, travel itinerary, photo for your visa
Cost: $160 
Where to apply: Application portal for your DS-160
After you successfully submit your DS-160, you will receive a printed confirmation with a barcode on it. Save this form – you will need it for your visa interview. 
4. Schedule Your Visa Interview
Find the nearest US embassy or consulate and schedule your visa interview. Wait times will vary by country and can take months — so remember to set up your appointments as early as possible!
If you are enrolling at a US university through Shorelight, ask your enrollment advisor about student visa interview tips or how to set up a mock interview session. Practicing your visa interview in advance will make you feel more comfortable with the process.
Ask your Shorelight advisor to set up a mock visa interview for you.
5. Attend Your Visa Interview
During the interview portion of the F-1 visa application process, the US consulate or embassy confirms you are coming to study as a legitimate, serious student. In your visa interview, you must also prove you have the funds to cover your time studying in the US, and confirm that you plan on returning home after your studies are complete. Attending your visa interview in person is required, though there are a few rare exceptions (e.g., if you are younger than 14 or older than 80 years of age, or if you meet certain visa renewal requirements). 
Cost: Your DS-160 payment covers the cost
Where to apply: Scheduling portal for your visa interview
After you successfully complete your visa interview, you will be granted your F-1 visa and acquire F-1 status. You are now cleared to study in the USA! 
Refer to Travel.state.gov to learn more. If you need any help with preparing or submitting your application, Shorelight provides application assistance for international students.
Before you attend your visa interview, make sure to have the following documents ready for evaluation by the consular officer:
A valid passport
A copy of the photo you will use for your visa
Printed copies of your DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmations
I-20 form
School transcript and official test scores cited on your university application
Diploma (if applicable)
Bank statements or other proof of finances
During your interview, the consular officer may request additional documents. To prepare, consider bringing the following documents:
Academic records such as transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates from schools you attended
Standardized test scores required by your US institution
Evidence of your intent to depart the United States upon completion of your course of study
Statements proving your ability to pay all educational, living, and travel costs
As an international student, you might feel uncertain about your upcoming interview. While feeling nervous is normal, do not forget to take a deep breath and remember that you are well prepared! Your interview is important, but should not be stressful.
Your interviewer will ask questions to determine: 
Are you a legitimate student?
Do you have the resources to pay for your studies?
Do you plan to return home after completing your degree?
To prepare for your F-1 student visa interview, here are some questions you might be asked: 
Why did you pick this university?
Which other US universities did you apply to?
How will you pay for your education?
Do you have relatives in the USA?
Do you plan to work while in the USA?
What do you plan to do after graduation?
Your Shorelight advisor can help you prepare for your interview by giving you a detailed overview of what the process will involve. They can also help you practice with mock interviews! Shorelight’s F-1 student visa interview guide can also help you learn more about what you can do to prepare for your upcoming interview. 
There is a possibility that your F-1 visa application will be denied. If this happens, you will be given detailed reasoning in writing, including the section of the law that led to the denial of your application.  
To avoid having your F-1 student visa application denied, it is important to read and follow all instructions carefully. Always double- and triple-check your documents before submitting your application. Shorelight advisors can offer visa assistance to make this process easier for you: They are happy to help you organize all the documents you will need, in the correct formats, and on schedule. 
Remember: During your F-1 student visa interview, you want to sufficiently demonstrate that you are traveling to the US to study and planning to return to your home country once your program is complete. Keep this in mind as you answer your interview questions.
As an international student, you must actively maintain your F-1 status to continue studying in the US. To do this, you must comply with both university regulations and codes of conduct, as well as with the requirements and conditions set out in your F-1 visa requirements. 
When entering the US:
Make sure to enter the US no more than 30 days before your program begins.
As soon as you arrive in the country, contact your designated school official (DSO).
When you arrive at your university, contact your DSO again before the start date listed on your I-20 form.
While studying in the US:
Attend all your classes and maintain good academic standing. If you require support with any of your classes, your Shorelight advisor can direct you to academic resources to help you improve.
If you need extra time to complete your program which would exceed the end date specified in your I-20, speak with your DSO to discuss your options for possible extensions.
Make sure to enroll for a full course of study when your academic term is in session.
If you want to drop a class or change classes, make sure to speak to your DSO first.
If you want to take a break and/or go on vacation, remember to first complete at least one full academic year at your institution.  After your holiday, you must also register for classes in the next academic term.
Yes, you will be able to work in the US on a F-1 student visa. However, you will have to follow certain F-1 visa rules and restrictions:
You can only work part time on campus while your academic term is in session
You can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week
You may be able to work off campus with the approval of your university
During academic breaks, you will be permitted to work full time, if your university allows it. You can learn more about working as a F-1 international student by referring to USCIS.gov.
When searching for work while you study, make sure to seek approval from your DSO first. 
Keep in mind, once you finish your program, you will have a grace period of 60 days to leave the US. If you wish to extend your stay, you can speak to a Shorelight advisor to explore your options, such as transferring to another school or pursuing further education. You can also refer to Shorelight’s F-1 extension guide to have a look at your options.
Now that you know how US non-immigrant visas work for international students, create a checklist of next steps and get started. The sooner you begin fulfilling the USA study visa requirements, the better chance you will have of securing your spot at an American university.

"The F-1 Student Visa, Explained","Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
What is the F-1 visa?
The F-1 visa allows a student to temporarily live in the United States for a defined period of time while studying at a school, college, seminary, or conservatory.
Is the F-1 visa right for me?
For many students, the chance to study in the United States is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. Unless the person is already a U.S. citizen or green card holder, all prospective students will have to apply for a visa to study in the United States.
Because there are so many courses and places to study in the United States, the F-1 visa has a pretty broad application but also some very clear rules. The first is that you have to be coming to the United States with the intent to temporarily study. In other words, this is not an immigrant visa.
You must be studying at an academic institution, not training at a vocational school, as this will require an M-1 visa. Your academic institution must be approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning it needs to be accredited to be able to accept foreign students on F-1 visas.
You will be able to work, but because this is a non-immigrant visa, you will be restricted to where you can work and the type of work. Finally, although your spouse and children can come with you, they will not be able to work but your children can enroll in schools. They will be on F-2 visas and tied to your visa’s status.
Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have. Learn more about what we do to help.
The requirements for an F-1 visa are:
For many students, the process of applying and being accepted into a U.S. academic institution is the lengthiest part. The visa process is a series of steps that take place after you accept an enrollment offer. Not sure if you qualify for an F-1 student visa? Start by checking your eligibility.
Congratulations, you have been accepted into a course of study by a U.S. academic institution! Years of hard work probably led you to this milestone, so here’s the process to obtain your student visa.
After your SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be added to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVP uses SEVIS to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M, and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.
Once you have registered with SEVIS, you will need to pay the I-901 fee. This fee is currently $350 for most people, and funds the SEVP program.
Your SEVP-approved school will then issue you a Form I-20. This form is incredibly important as it confirms your acceptance at the school, and therefore your eligibility for the F-1 visa. Once this Form I-20 has been issued, you will be able to apply to a U.S. embassy or consulate for your F-1 visa.
The steps required will vary between different U.S. embassies or consulates, so make sure you check their websites for further information.
However, you must complete the Form DS-160, which is similar to the Form DS-260 for immigrant visas. The form is very detailed and can take some time to fill in, so make sure you set aside plenty of time to complete it.
Once you have completed the Form DS-160, you will need to schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, unless you are under 13 years of age or over 80 years of age. The U.S. Department of State says you should schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country where you live. You may schedule your interview at another U.S. embassy or consulate, but be aware that it may be more difficult to qualify for a visa outside of the country where you live.
Prior to your interview, you will need to pay the $185 application fee and also, depending on your nationality, pay an issuance fee, as well. The visa issuance fee is only due after your interview, if your visa is approved. The next step will be an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate.
Visa wait times can vary depending on the time of year and location. You can use the appointment wait time tool to see how long you will have to wait for an appointment at a specific U.S. embassy or consulate.
At this stage, it is important to note that F-1 visas for new students can only be issued up to 365 days (one year) in advance of the start date for a course of study. It used to be 120 days, but in February, 2023, the State Department extended the period.
Note: For existing F-1 visas, this is not the case and visas can be issued any time, as long as the student is currently enrolled at a SEVP-approved school or institution and in SEVIS.
Boundless not only makes it easy for you to complete your F-1 student visa application, but we can also help you get ready for your visa interview. Learn more about what you get with Boundless.
You will generally be required to attend an interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate. You will need to bring:
You should also be prepared to bring evidence of:
During your interview, the consular officer will ask you questions to determine whether or not to approve your F-1 visa. Make sure you are complete and accurate in your answers, as you will be under oath. For interview tips, see the Boundless guide on preparing for the F-1 student visa interview.
The consular officer will also take your fingerprints, although this will vary depending on your location. After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing. The consular officer will let you know if this is required.

Yes, you can bring your spouse and children with you. Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
F-1 students cannot work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students can engage in three types of off-campus employment:
This depends on your individual taxation situation, but typically you might be required to file a U.S. tax return. For more information, seek advice from a qualified tax professional.
Generally, an F-1 student may transfer between SEVP-certified schools. However, this does involve paperwork and coordination. See here for more detailed instructions.
There are some programs and visas available for F-1 visa holders after you finish studying in the United States. These can be highly individual to your circumstances, field of study, and professional background, so do your research carefully.

How to Apply for an F1 Visa,"Register Now!






	Any international student wanting to study in the USA will need to obtain a student visa for the USA. Most students are issued with an F1 visa, and the general outline/process flow for obtaining an F1 visa is as follows:



Now that you have an initial idea of the process flow, lets go into more detail on each stage:
Before you can apply for your F1 student visa for the USA, you must apply to and be accepted by a school approved by the SEVP.

Search US Schools

	Once you’re accepted, you will be required to pay the SEVIS I-901 Fee in order to be enrolled in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). Then, your school will provide you with a Form I-20. This form will be presented to the consular officer when you attend your F1 visa interview. If your spouse and/or children plan to reside in the USA with you while you study, they will be required to have individual Form I-20s, but they will not need to be enrolled in the SEVIS.


	Applying for the F1 student visa may vary depending on the U.S. embassy or consulate you are dealing with. You will be required to pay a non-refundable visa application fee. There is an online visa application available, which allows you to complete and print the Form DS-160 to take to your F1 visa interview.


	You can schedule your F1 visa interview with the U.S. embassy or consulate. Wait times for interview appointments vary by location, season, and visa category, so you should apply for your visa early. An F1 student visa for the USA can be issued up to 120 days in advance of your course of study start date. You will only be able to enter the US with an F1 visa 30 days before your start date.

The following documents are required for your F1 visa interview:

	Additional documents may be requested to prove your eligibility for the F1 student visa, including academic transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates. Test scores such as the TOEFL, SAT, GRE, or GMAT may also be requested, as well as proof of your intent to depart the U.S. after your program is complete and proof of your financial stability.


	Your F1 visa interview will determine whether you are qualified to receive an F1 student visa for the USA. Assuming that you have prepared the appropriate documents and meet all of the F1 visa requirements, your visa will be approved at the discretion of the consular officer.


	You may be required to pay a visa issuance fee. Digital fingerprint scans will be taken for records. Your passport will be taken so that you can get your visa and you will be informed when you can get it back, either by pick-up or in the mail.


	Keep in mind that visa issuance is not guaranteed. Never make final travel plans until you have your visa approved. If your visa is denied, you will be given a reason based on the section of law which applies to your ineligibility. Filing a waiver of ineligibility is possible in some cases.

US student visa requirements, eligibility criteria, the application steps and FAQs
In this article
The F1 visa is a student visa that is given to international students who want to attend educational institutions in the United States. It covers levels from elementary school to university and graduate school, including other degrees.
To qualify to even apply for an F1 visa you must meet some specific conditions, such as:
Here are the documents required to apply for an F1 Visa:
To application process for the F1 visa goes through the following steps:
After you apply and are accepted into the school you want to attend, they will have to complete some procedures so that you can apply for the F1 visa. The most important document you need to have is Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status. Without this form, you will not be able to apply for an F1 student visa and attend your interview.
After you get your Form I-20, you can start the usual application process. This includes filing the DS-160 form online with the necessary information about your visa status.
The application fee for the student visa is $185. You must pay this fee and get the receipt, which you will need later for your interview documents. You might have to pay additional fees based on your country of origin and the US Embassy you are applying from.
When you are admitted by the SEVP institution, your school immediately registers you in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). To have full registration, there is a SEVIS I-901 fee. For the F1 visa, this fee is $200.
After filing the DS-160 form and paying the fees, you will need to schedule your interview. The interview is a mandatory step before you get your student visa. Try to schedule it as early as possible, since there might be delays due to the heavy workload of the US Embassy. When you schedule it, you will receive an interview appointment letter which you will need later on in the application process.
Before you go to attend your interview, you should prepare your file with the required documents for students.
When you go to attend the student visa interview, the questions will mostly revolve around your reasons for going to the US and the institution you are going to. The interviewer will try to assess whether you intend to return to your home country after you complete your degree.
When your visa is approved, it might be for the full time that you will be in school in the US, or for less. If your study program takes 1 year to graduate, the Embassy will most likely give you a visa that is valid for 1 year If your degree program is 2 years and you only get the visa for 1 year, you should then later apply to renew it. In this case, it is the best option to renew the F1 visa.
The validity of your F1 visa is for as long as it is stated on your I-20 form and I-94 form which is given to you when you enter the US.
If you are renewing your visa you should follow the same procedure. You might be able to waive the interview on the reason that you have already done it once and your intent is to continue your education for the remaining years to get your degree.
If your visa is approved, you are allowed to depart for the US 30 days before your program begins. You cannot enter the US any earlier than that.
In most cases, you will get the response on this visa immediately after the interview. At the end of the visa interview, the interviewer might congratulate you for getting the visa or will provide you with a document letting you know the reason for denial. This is because the processing of this type of visa actually happens before your interview. The interview is the last step for the US Embassy to assess whether they should issue the visa.
There are, however, cases where the response and processing of the F1 visa takes a few days, so you should be patient if that happens.
After you are admitted into the institution of your choice, you can apply for the visa 120 days before you are scheduled to start your program. You cannot apply any earlier, but applying later might cause you a delay due to processing times. So as soon as the 120-day countdown begins, make sure you submit your application.
After your visa expires, you have a 60 day grace period to prepare for your departure to your home country. If your visa doesn’t cover the whole time that you will be in school in the US, you will have to apply for renewal or extensions. The extensions are approved only if you can prove you will be completing your degree in the US and you intend to return as soon as it is over.
You may work as an F1 student but only for short periods of time since your visa is a student and not a work visa. You are allowed to work part-time on campus while school is in session and full time during breaks. If you want to work outside of campus, you have two options.
If you, for example, find a job that requires a different type of visa, other than F1, then you are also eligible to change status. You just need to work through the instructions of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and your employer or another petitioner.
Even though you have proved that you have strong ties to your home country, if you want to apply for a Green Card, you are allowed to do so on an F1 visa. It is a complicated procedure, though. You must either self-petition as a person with extraordinary abilities, get married in the US or prove that you will invest $500,000 in the US economy.
If these are not feasible for you, but you still want to remain in the US, the easiest way is to change status into a different type of visa such as an H-1B visa and have your employer sponsor you.
F1 visa students quite often have to travel abroad. They travel during university breaks or in case of emergencies. The travel can be to their own home countries or to other countries.
If you are an F1 visa student who wants to travel abroad, before you plan and book their travel you must follow some instructions. The instructions are to ensure that they can enter the United States again.
In case you have dependents, such as a spouse or unmarried children under 21 years old, they are allowed to come to the US too. This can be done with an F2 visa.
The F2 visa has no cap and dependents should just fulfill the requirements and complete the application procedures to get the visa. To be eligible for an F-2 visa, you must fulfill the following criteria:

International students who wish to enter the United States for the purposes of furthering their studies can apply for an F1 Student Visa.
Call us on +1 844 290 6312 for immediate help & assistance with your situation. We’re here to help you in person, via the phone, or online.

The F1 Visa allows eligible international students who wish to attend a full course of study at colleges, universities, and high schools in the United States. The academic institution attended must be certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). In addition, this student visa can be used by foreign nationals coming to the country to attend a language training program.
While in the country, international students are free not only to study and live in the United States but they can also travel abroad without losing their visa status. In addition, F1 visa holders can open a bank account and obtain a driver’s license.
Furthermore, the F1 Visa cannot be used to attend publicly funded adult education programs. Those who would like to pursue a course of study that is not academic, such as post-secondary vocational or business schools, should apply for an M-1 Visa.
The Student Visa does not have an annual cap, meaning that the visa application can be processed as soon as it is submitted which is only a few business days.
To be eligible for this student visa, international students must meet the following requirements:
If you would like to apply for a student F1 visa, you will first need to apply to a SEVP-approved academic institution. For a list of SEVP-certified schools, you should go to Study in the States to search for a list of approved academic institutions.
You must then be registered in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) where you will need to pay the SEVIS I-901 fee. After the SEVIS fee payment has been made, you will then be issued Form I-20 from your school.
If you have eligible dependents (spouses and unmarried children under 21) that you would like to bring with you to the US, they must also enroll in SEVIS to obtain their individual I-20 Forms for their dependent F2 visas. Dependents do not need to pay the SEVIS fee.
You may then begin the F-1 visa application process at your nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. To do this, the visa applicants will need to complete Form DS-160 (Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application), submit supporting documentation, and attend a visa interview.
You can file your application form online or at your local U.S. Embassy or Consulate. For the F1 Visa, you will need the following supporting documents to make your visa application:
The last step of your application is an interview, which is required to determine whether or not you qualify for a Student Visa. If you are abroad, this will take place at your nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.
At this visa interview, the consular officer will review your documents and ask you questions about your academic qualifications and choice of university. They will ask questions about the course you are planning to take, as well as your reasons behind opting to study in the US.
You will be required to demonstrate your willingness to return to your home country at the end of your course of study and future plans.
Most importantly, you will need to prove that you have enough means to finance your education and your life in the U.S. The interviewer may ask about your income, who is sponsoring your education and how you plan to cover living expenses while studying.
Attending a visa interview can be daunting so make sure you prepare in advance. Try to keep your answers concise and factual.

One of the F-1 Visa requirements is to prove that you do not wish to settle in the United States. To help prove that you do not want to immigrate to the United States, visa applicants must show they maintain strong ties with their home country.
To support their F-1 Visa application, visa applicants may prove their non-immigrant intent by demonstrating the following:
Your visa also indicates the amount of time you can legally stay in the U.S. This usually coincides with the total length of your studies. However, if you need extra time, you can apply for an F-1 Visa renewal.
You need to produce a letter stating the reason for your request so that your designated school official can extend your permit.
If you are going to travel abroad for a short time and your F-1 Visa will expire while you are away, you will need to re-apply for it before you can re-enter the country.
If you fail to maintain your F1 Visa status, you will lose your right to live and study in the U.S.
This can happen as a result of one of the following circumstances:
You can enter the U.S. 30 days before the registration date printed on your Firm I-20. In addition, you have a further 60 day grace period in the country following the completion of your course.
If you have been admitted to a U.S. university, but are still waiting for your I-20, you may travel to the U.S. for a valid reason. For example, you may need to attend your visa interview appointment at the consulate. In this case, you can submit an application for a B-2 Visitor Visa with a “prospective student” annotation. This permit will let you enter the country for a short time.
It should be noted that foreign students may not study after entering on a visitor visa (B2 Visa) or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) unless that study is recreational, non-credit, and an allowed program of study under the B-2 Tourist visa.
To get your F1 Visa status, you must be enrolled in a full-time program. Consequently, you may not have any free time to work. However, in limited circumstances, you may get permission to work part-time on-campus as a part of your practical training only after the first year of study is over. International students on an F-1 visa may engage in the following types of off-campus employment:
Those who would like to work off-campus in other types of off-campus employment can do so if they can prove that they are in severe economic hardship because of unforeseen circumstances. This may include:
As with any other U.S. visa, the F1 Student visa can be denied for a number of reasons. If you receive a rejection, the USCIS will detail the reasons for the denial in the rejection letter after the application has been processed. F1 Student visas can be rejected for a variety of reasons including the following:
To minimize your chances of the visa application being rejected, it is important that you complete the visa application thoroughly and truthfully. To make sure that your application is completed to the highest standard, it is recommended that an immigration lawyer experienced in handling student visas, check the application along with the portfolio of supporting documents.
Furthermore, an immigration attorney can also advise you on your options if you find that your application has been denied.
As well as the cost of education in the United States, international students will be expected to pay the following fees in order to obtain an F-1 visa:

The F1 Visa is a non-immigrant permit for international students, meaning it does not create a path to U.S. settlement. Consequently, you cannot directly move from an F1 visa to a Green Card.
While on a Student Visa, you are not allowed to apply for permanent residence. This would be considered a violation of status, resulting in a temporary ban from the U.S. However, you may try to adjust your status.
One good idea could be to apply for an H-1B visa. This permit is designed for foreign nationals that hold a degree in a specialized field, such as IT, finance, or science.
However, if you do not wish to contend your place with other participants in the annual lottery, you can file your I-129 Form to petition for other visas.
Once you have obtained a dual intent visa, you may immediately file for a Green Card. For example, if you already got a master’s degree, you may want to consider an EB-2 immigrant Green Card.
Before you can petition for a new status, you must have been in F1 status for at least one academic year.
U.S. visa processing time will depend on the U.S. Embassy or Consulate from where the international student is applying. Some embassies and consulates might take longer than others due to a backlog or a heavy workload.
Typically, visas can be processed anywhere from 3 days to several weeks. Of course, this will depend on the strength of the application and that no additional evidence or documents will be required. It should be noted that visa applications that require the submission of additional information can take months to process.
It is currently faster to apply for an F2B visa than an F1 visa. That said, this can change and it is always best to refer to the Department of State’s monthly visa bulletin for progress and updates on the various visas that are available for the US.
If your F1 visa application has been rejected and you wish to receive professional guidance, you can entrust your case with one of our immigration attorneys. IAS will assist in obtaining your F-1 Visa and deliver only the best strategy necessary for your application.

F-1 Visa Application Process,"The difference between U.S. immigration status and a visa stamp is an important and sometimes confusing concept. F-1 status can be extended, shortened or even changed to a different immigration status (such as the H-1B) while you are inside the U.S., yet your F-1 visa stamp does not have to match your immigration status while you are inside the United States.
The visa stamp is only necessary for travel purposes. Initial entry and subsequent re-entry into the U.S. from abroad requires a valid visa corresponding to your particular immigration status at all times. However, you do not need to depart the U.S. if your visa stamp expires as long as your F-1 (or other) immigration status is still valid.
The U.S. Department of State has more information about the visa application process, visa fee payments, and reasons for possible delays in the issuing of U.S. visas.
Canadian citizens are not required to obtain a visa stamp from a U.S. consulate. Canadians are inspected at the U.S. border and admitted there in F-1 status
Do not schedule a visa appointment until you have received your Form I-20 from Dartmouth. Apply for the visa at the nearest U.S. consulate or embassy in your country with jurisdiction over your residence abroad. Appointment procedures and times vary from consulate to consulate, so check for details at the U.S. consulate where you will apply. The Department of State recently updated its policy to allow new F-1 students to apply for the F-1 visa stamp up to 365 days prior to the program start date on the Form I-20, but new students cannot enter the U.S. earlier than 30 days before that date.
There are two application fees for F-1 visas. There is a one-time SEVIS fee. A standard worldwide Machine Readable Visa (MRV).
Depending on your own country's policy on fees for U.S. citizens, you may also have to pay a reciprocity fee. Depending on how far away the nearest U.S. consulate is from your home, you may also need to allow for additional travel and accommodation costs to get to your nearest consulate city.
Your F-1 status is valid as long as you are maintaining full-time enrollment and satisfactory progress in your degree program, even if your F-1 visa expires. You would only need to obtain a new, extended visa if you have plans to depart the U.S. for a visit abroad and re-enter the United States.
You may legally remain in the U.S. if your F-1 visa has expired, without any negative consequences, as long as your F-1 status is still valid.
It may be possible for you to change your status from another valid nonimmigrant status in the U.S. to F-1 status.  This requires filing an application for change of status with USCIS using Form I-539, and paying the USCIS filing fee.  
The request for change of status is a personal application. While OVIS can provide general guidance and issue the Form I-20 you will need in support of the application, the application filing and filing fee are your responsibility. You may wish to consult a qualified immigration attorney for a consultation regarding the change of status process and your specific situation.
To file a Form I-539 request for change of status you must be in a valid status at the time of application, must be eligible for F-1 status at the time you file, and your nonimmigrant status must not expire more than 30 days before the requested start date on the Form I-20.  If the change of status application will not be approved before the requested start date on the Form I-20, the F-1 sponsor must defer the start date to avoid automatic cancellation of the F-1 record in the SEVIS system.  
The Form I-539 includes a USCIS filing fee and a biometrics fee.  Applicants will be required to attend a biometrics appointment for photograph and fingerprinting at a designated location. USCIS will issue the biometrics appointment notice after the application is received.
Changes of status can take many months to be processed by USCIS, and international travel is prohibited when the application is filed, and while it is pending.  For this reason, you may wish to consider traveling overseas to apply for the F-1 visa stamp at a U.S. consulate or embassy, preferably in your home country, and seeking reentry to the U.S. in F-1 status.  You should carefully consider whether international travel is the best option based on your personal situation, considering such factors as ability to travel, wait times at the U.S. consular post, and others.
You can find the link to the Form I-539 and instructions to the Form I-539 on the USCIS website.

Before you can apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for an F or M student visa, you must first apply to and be accepted by a SEVP approved school. Visit the Department of Homeland Security Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.
When you are accepted by the U.S. school you plan to attend, you will be enrolled in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). You must pay the SEVIS I-901 Fee. The U.S. school will provide you with a Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1/M-1) Student Status-For Academic and Language Students (Form I-20) to present to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview. If your spouse and/or children intend to reside with you in the United States while you study, they must obtain individual Form I-20s, but they do not pay the SEVIS fee. Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee
Before you can apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a J-1 visa, you must first apply for and be accepted into an exchange visitor program through a designated sponsoring organization. Visit the Department of State J-1 Visa Exchange Visitor Program website to learn about program requirements, regulations, and more.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website. 
If you are interested in changing to F or M Student Status, see the Changing to a Nonimmigrant F or M Student Status page.

On April 2, 2024, the U.S.
While studying in the United States, it is important to maintain your F or M student status. Your status relates to the purpose, or reason for why you want to come to the United States. The U.S. Department of State issues you your visa based on your intended purpose. 
If the Department of State issues you an F or M student visa, this means that you are coming to the United States to study. You should not take any action that detracts from that purpose. Maintaining your status means:
Fulfilling the purpose for why the Department of State issued you your visa.
Following the regulations associated with that purpose.
F-1 and M-1 students share the same primary purpose for coming to the United States however, F-1 students enroll in more traditional academic programs, while M-1 students enroll in vocational programs. Because these two types of programs are different in nature, the types of benefits an international student may be eligible for and how long they may remain in the country depend on whether they are an F-1 or M-1 student.  Learn more about these specific differences by reviewing the F&M Student Status: Know the Difference infographic.
Below are actions to take in order to properly maintain your status.
When arriving to the United States, both F and M students must:
Enter the United States no more than 30 days before your program of study begins.
Immediately contact your designated school official (DSO) when you enter the United States.
When you arrive at school, you need to contact your DSO again, no later than the program start date listed on your Form I-20, ""Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.""
While studying in the United States, both F and M students must:
F-1 students must complete at least one full academic year at an SEVP-certified school to be eligible for annual vacation. Additionally, students must intend to register for classes in the academic term following their annual vacation.
SEVP-certified schools should have clear and consistent policies regarding annual vacation and comply with the requirements laid out in SEVP Policy Guidance for Adjudicators 1408-01: Academic Year.
Please note that during an annual vacation, students can take as many, as few or no courses as they want. SEVP considers all study during an annual vacation incident to status.
An F student may only work when authorized by a DSO in some cases, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in others. If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately, and you may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date. 
F students are also eligible for optional practical training during or following the program of study. OPT is a form of temporary employment that directly relates to your program of study. 
For more information about employment and training options available for F-students, visit the Working in the United States page and talk with your DSO.
M-1 students are not eligible for employment during their program of study, but may obtain authorization for practical training employment. You may participate in practical training employment after the completion of your vocational program. 
If you want to participate in practical training employment in the United States, talk with your DSO about your options. Practical training employment requires your DSO’s recommendation and authorization from USCIS. 
If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately. You may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date.
F and M students must take action to maintain legal status or depart the United States after completing your program of study.
Once you complete your program of study and any authorized period of practical training, F students have 60 days after completion of your program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. If you wish to extend your stay in the United States, talk with your DSO to learn more about doing one of the following:
Transfer to another school.
Change your education level (e.g. bachelor’s to master’s).
Apply to change status  to another visa status (e.g. H-1B-temporary worker; O-extraordinary ability in science, art or business; P-athlete).
M students have 30 days after completion of their program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. The latest date you may remain in the United States is the “admit until” date on your Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record,” unless you filed for an extension with USCIS.
If you are an F or M student studying in the United States, your DSO should be the first person you talk with if you have any questions regarding the legal requirements of your stay in the United States. Your DSO can assist in answering your questions or help you find someone who can help.
M-1 students should speak with their DSO if they are planning to do any of the following:
Take a break from school.
Travel outside the United States.
Move to a new address.
Request a program extension.
Both F and M students may contact SEVP by email at sevp@ice.dhs.gov if your DSO is unable to assist you or if you would prefer to ask someone else.
In your email, please describe your situation and include any questions you have. SEVP provides responses on a first-come, first-served basis. Answer times may vary depending on the current number of inquiries.

Congratulations on your decision to study in the United States. Nonimmigrant students who come to the United States to study must follow specific rules. However, different rules apply depending on your student type and education level. Learn what student type and education level applies to you below:
Student Type:
Education Level:

Your first step is to apply to a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school in the United States. Use the School Search tool to find SEVP-certified schools and programs that are eligible to enroll F-1 and M-1 students. For more information about the types of programs that are available to you, please visit EducationUSA.
If you are a student currently enrolled in the equivalent of a kindergarten through grade 12 program, visit the Kindergarten to Grade 12 page on Study in the States.
The Form I-20
Once you are accepted into an SEVP-certified school, your school’s designated school official will send you a document called the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” The Form I-20 is a paper record of your information in our Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) database. Each school that accepts you will mail you a Form I-20.
For more information, visit the Students and the Form I-20 page.
After receiving your Form I-20, you must pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee.
Federal regulations require all F, M and J students pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee before applying for their U.S. student visa. You can pay your I-901 SEVIS Fee online at FMJfee.com or by using Western Union Quick Pay. You must present the receipt as proof of payment when you apply for visa. It’s important that the SEVIS ID number on your I-901 SEVIS Fee receipt matches your SEVIS ID number on your Form I-20. If it does not, or you encounter other issues paying your fee, please contact SEVP.
I-901 SEVIS Fee Assistance:
Learn more about the I-901 SEVIS Fee:
After paying the I-901 SEVIS Fee and getting a receipt, you must apply for a visa at any U.S. Embassy or Consulate before you come to the United States.
To receive a visa, you will have to participate in an in-person interview. During your visa interview, you will need to establish that you meet the requirements under U.S. law to receive the category of visa for which you are applying. The consular officer will determine if you qualify to receive a visa and which visa category is appropriate based on your purpose of travel.
A visa does not guarantee entrance to the United States; it only permits you to arrive and seek permission to enter the country. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the U.S. port of entry has the final authority to admit entry into the country.
The following pages will assist with this process:
Before you leave for the United States, familiarize yourself with the different documents you will need or could need when you arrive. It is also a good idea to make at least two sets of copies of these documents: one copy to leave with your family before you depart and one copy to give to your school officials. Required documents include your:
It is also smart to have your acceptance letter, proof of financial ability and any other supporting documentation with you, in case the Customs and Border Protection officer asks for them. You should carry your original travel documents on you at all times while traveling. Do not put them in your checked baggage. For more information on traveling to the United States, visit the Getting to the United States page.
When you arrive to the United States you will meet a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry, who will verify your information and determine if you may enter the country.
If the officer cannot initially verify your information, or if you do not have all of the required documentation, you may be directed to an interview area known as “secondary inspection.” Secondary inspection allows inspectors to conduct additional research in order to verify information without causing delays for other arriving passengers.
The inspector will first attempt to verify your status by using SEVIS. In the event that the CBP officer needs to verify information with your school or program, we strongly recommend that you have the name and telephone number of the designated school official (DSO) at your school on hand. If you arrive during non-business hours (evening, weekends, holidays), you should also have an emergency or non-business hour phone number available for this official.
Failure to comply with U.S. government entry-exit procedures may result in your being denied entry to the United States. Under certain circumstances, the CBP officer may issue a Form I-515A, “Notice to Student or Exchange Visitor,” which authorizes temporary admission into the United States. Work with your school without delay to submit the proper documentation required by the Form I-515A. Failing to comply with a Form I-515A will result in the termination of your status. Read SEVP’s Form I-515A Noncompliance Termination procedure to ensure you understand how to properly respond and maintain your status.
If the CBP officer admits you into the country, you will be given a Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record.” This form shows that you have been legally admitted into the United States, the class of admission and your authorized period of stay. It is very important that the information on the record is correct. Inconsistencies between the information on the Form I-94 and SEVIS records can reduce the chances of a successful systems interface and can result in denial of benefits or difficulty re-entering the country.
You have 30 days to enter the country before your official program start date, as listed on your Form I-20. If you do not report to your school by your program start date, your DSO may terminate your SEVIS record. We suggest that you contact your school immediately once you enter the country so that there is no question of your arrival.
If you cannot enter the United States for the term listed on your Form I-20, contact your school officials as soon as possible so that they can update your record so your plans are accurately reflected in SEVIS.
As an F or M student, you will often hear the phrase “maintaining status.” Maintaining your status means that you are fulfilling the purpose for why the U.S. Department of State issued you your visa and following the regulations associated with that purpose. Remember, a student visa is a travel document you receive from a U.S. consulate or embassy before you enter the United States. Your student status is what you must maintain after you are granted entrance into the United States. Learn more about the rules you must follow by talking to your DSO and reviewing the Maintaining Status page on Study in the States.
While studying in the United States, you may be eligible to apply for certain benefits. These student benefits are not granted by SEVP and require students to apply to other government agencies to receive them. The benefits you are eligible for will depend on your student status. Visit the following pages to learn more about potential student benefits:
As a note, most employment and training opportunities require authorization from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). For more information, visit the Employment page on ICE.gov.
If you are having an immediate problem and need assistance quickly, please speak with your DSO or responsible officer. If that person cannot help you, contact the SEVP Response Center at 1-703-603-3400 or at SEVP@ice.dhs.gov.
Once you have completed your program and fulfilled your purpose for coming to the United States, you may have a number of options. These include changing your status, applying for training, transferring to another SEVP-certified school or leaving the country.
Please note there are restrictions that apply to M-1 students regarding transferring and changing status. Talk to your DSO to understand what your options are.
If after your program is complete you do not qualify to stay in the country, or chose to depart, please be advised:
You can also visit USCIS to learn about naturalization and the path to U.S. citizenship.

Visa Compliance - International Academy Student Portal,"If you are studying on a USC International Academy I-20, you are considered a full-time student and must maintain full-time status during your stay. If you do not fulfill this and other responsibilities, you may jeopardize your legal status in the United States.
We encourage you to see an Admissions and Immigration Adviser if you have any questions, doubts, or concerns about your legal status and responsibilities. Schedule an appointment by emailing: info-international@usc.edu
As a F-1 student visa holder, you have important responsibilities. Some of these responsibilities include:
Please remember to notify one of the Admissions and Immigration Advisers in the following scenarios:
Program extensions must be requested in writing.
At the end of each term, students are required to complete a Stay/Go Form. You will receive the Stay/Go Form in your Reading and Writing class 3-4 weeks before your program end date.
If you plan to stay at the Academy, you will choose “Stay” on the form and your enrollment will be extended into the following term. If you successfully complete levels 3, 4, or 5 in the Intensive English Program, you can choose to take one of the preparation programs the following term. Make sure to review the Financial Statement Requirements, too.
Want to stay for more than one term?  Contact the Admissions Office in person or via email/phone and request an extension. Unless the request is made in writing, you will be asked to sign a Program Change Form.
If you plan to leave the Academy, you will choose “Go” on the form and your enrollment will not be extended. Students who have an F1 visa need to leave the U.S. or have their I-20 transferred  to another school within 60 days from their program end date. Students planning to transfer to another school need to contact an Admissions and Immigration Adviser as soon as they can to initiate the transfer process. I-20 transfer students need to present a Letter of Acceptance from another SEVIS certified institution and submit a completed Transfer Out Form.
Students who want to terminate their enrollment before their program end date need to submit the request in writing and do not have to wait for the Stay/Go forms to be distributed. All program terminations require that a Program Change Form is completed and signed by a student.
Program changes can be made within 5 calendar days after the program start date. A Program Change Form needs to be signed by a student for the change to take effect. In an exceptional situation, an email request to change programs can be accepted in lieu of the Program Change Form.
There are two types of changes:
To request a program change, please fill out the Program Change Form and submit it to info-international@usc.edu or the DCC Front Desk.
Students on a USC International Academy I-20 who plan on traveling outside of the U.S. will need a travel signature from the Admissions and Immigration Advisor on the second page of their I-20.
Please see the Admissions and Immigration Advisor to discuss any issues regarding your travel plans.
You may be eligible to take a vacation for one term if you have successfully completed 28 weeks of uninterrupted full time study, have good academic performance, attended minimum 85% of all classes, have a valid visa and I-20 with an end date that covers your vacation as well as the next term of study. You would remain on USC International Academy’s I-20 and enroll in the next term after vacation. Please note that I-20 length cannot be extended because of your vacation. I-20 extensions are granted for academic or medical reasons only.
If you would like to take vacation, you need to contact the Admissions and Immigration Adviser who will determine your eligibility. You need to make all arrangements before the end of the term. If your vacation is approved, before you leave you will need to finalize your enrollment, pay a $1000 non-refundable tuition deposit (down payment) to guarantee your return for the stated term. Intensive English students are eligible to take max. 7 week vacation; Undergraduate Preparation, Master’s Preparation and Pre-Master’s Preparation students may take max. 14 weeks’ vacation.

Report changes such as name, dependent name, or immigration status:
Federal immigration regulations require nonimmigrant students in F-1 or J-1 status to be enrolled in a full-time course load each term to maintain nonimmigrant visa status. Students who are not enrolled full time by the end of each add/drop period or who drop below full-time without approval by the OISS violate their student immigration status.
OISS is committed to working closely with NU schools, departments, students, and the Office of the Registrar to ensure all students are enrolled in a full course load each term.
Full-time enrollment is required in the summer term only if it is a student's first or last term of enrollment.
Students must be physically present on Northwestern's campus during every quarter of enrollment unless otherwise approved for study or research abroad.
OISS is required to report in the Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) whether a student is enrolled full-time at Northwestern University, received an authorized reduced course load, dropped below a full course of study without prior authorization by a Designated School Official (OISS Advisor), or failed to enroll.
Failure to meet the full-time enrollment requirement without an approved authorized reduced course load may result in your SEVIS record being terminated.
 
 
For both graduate and undergraduate F-1 and J-1 students, only one unit or 1 credit of online/remote course may count toward the full-time enrollment requirement. The one unit/credit limit is for every academic term when students are expected to be enrolled full-time.  
If F-1 or J-1 students enroll in more than their minimum unit requirement, they MAY enroll in more than one unit of online/remote courses.
Hybrid courses with required on-campus components do not count towards this limitation.
Students on an approved reduced course load (see below) cannot be enrolled in only online/remote coursework.
On-campus presence refers to the regulatory requirement for international students in F-1 or J-1 status to enroll in coursework that ""requires the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to the completion of the class."" Students must register for a certain number of credit hours that are taught using an instruction mode that requires in-person attendance. Students must be physically present on campus during every quarter of enrollment unless otherwise approved for study or research abroad.
Under certain circumstances, F-1 students may receive approval from OISS to enroll in a reduced course load and maintain their student status.
If you need a reduced course load for medical reasons or academic difficulties, talk with your OISS Advisor as soon as possible. You cannot drop below a full course of study unless your OISS Advisor approves the reduced course load and updates your student record in SEVIS.
More information about exceptions to the full-time enrollment requirement
Students cannot be enrolled in only online coursework, even if approved for a reduced course load by OISS. See below for more information on reduced course load (RCL).
 
 
In certain situations, students may be authorized for less than full-time enrollment for specific academic reasons.   
A reduced course load for specific academic reasons requires recommendation of student’s academic or major advisor. There are three types of academic reduced course loads available to international students:  
Students cannot be enrolled in only online coursework, even if approved for a reduced course load by OISS. 
If you qualify for Reduced Course Load, please submit your request at the OISS Portal. If you request a reduced course load for academic difficulties or concurrent enrollment, please email or schedule an appointment with your OISS Advisor.  
Students may apply for RCL due to a medical condition documented by a licensed medical doctor (MD), doctor of osteopathy (DO), psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or clinical psychologist. Please note:  
If you qualify for Reduced Course Load, please submit your request at the OISS Portal. 
Federal regulations limit F-1 and J-1 student employment options.
You my not work off-campus without prior approval and authorization from OISS.
To attain authorization, please review our student employment information and then meet with an advisor if you have questions.
U.S. federal immigration regulations require all international students to maintain a permanent foreign address and current U.S. address. These are maintained as your Permanent (non-U.S. address) and Current (U.S. address) Address in CAESAR, and these are automatically reported to SEVIS.
Failure to correctly maintain these addresses may result in a delay in processing any requests.
All NU students are required to maintain accurate emergency information in their CAESAR account, which includes listing your emergency contacts phone number and address.
How to update your emergency contact in CAESAR

If you require immigration permission  to study at LSE, you must ensure that you satisfy the Home Office terms and conditions of your immigration permission for the duration of your visa. This is a legal obligation and failure to do so may result in LSE withdrawing its sponsorship of you. Both LSE and you have some key responsibilities.
It is essential that you:
This will include
To provide new scans; taught student should contact the Student Advice and Engagement Team  and PhD Students should contact PhD Academy.
You should submit an enquiry as soon as you receive notification of a visa refusal. 
You must ensure that your details in LSE for You are kept up to date. This includes:
You can let the Home Office know of any changes by reporting a change of circumstance. 
Visit the Home Office's Report a change of circumstances if you have a visa or BRP page for more information. 
Student Services (for taught students) or PhD Academy (for PhD students) may request information about your immigration status to maintain our records. You must respond to these queries quickly and within the deadline.
These requests will always be made via your LSE email. 
You must provide accurate, complete and truthful information when requesting a new Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) statement, including any visa refusals for the UK. 
This includes details of any previous periods of study in the UK.

Postgraduate taught and PhD students are exempt from the time limits on degree level study. 
You must attend all your lectures and classes as scheduled with no unauthorised absences. 
You are required to attend all teaching sessions as scheduled on your personal timetable. If you wish to attend a session at a different time, always seek authorisation from your Department before you do so. Attending seminar sessions that you are not registered to attend without authorisation from your Department will result in your attendance not being recorded accurately.

Please note that the Spring Term extend to the summer and until their expected programme end date for 12-month masters students and Year 2 students on 24-masters programmes.Even if your assessments are online, you have agreed under the Conditions of Registration and Enrolment to remain in close proximity to campus. If you plan to return home prior to the Spring Term Exams and remain overseas throughout this period and your dissertation period, we will withdraw sponsorship of your visa because you are residing overseas.  This will affect your eligiblity for the Graduate Route.You can find out more about the School's Engagement Montioring Policy here.
If you interrupt your studies or withdraw from the School, LSE will cancel our sponsorship and you will need to leave the UK.
If you are considering interrupting or withdrawing and hold a Student visa you are strongly encouraged to seek advice from the Student Advice and Engagement Team.
These are likely to include:
For more information about how to meet these conditions visit this page.

LSE's legal responsibilities as a Student sponsor include:
 
We keep copies of your immigration documentation in the format of colour scans. 
In most cases we take these scans at enrolment but if your circumstances change we will need to take new scans.
The Student Advice and Engagement Team completes Data Quality Checks post-enrolment, so we may contact you for further information.  
We will check that you have updated your contact details in LSE for You. This includes:
We will inform the Home Office immediately if a Student visa holder:
We check the class and/or seminar registers for all students holding Student visas.  
We will report unsatisfactory engagement to the Home Office, but you will be informed before this course of action is taken.
Issue Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) for students who are eligible to study in the UK under current Home Office immigration rules.

Student Visa


Exchange Visitor Visa


Generally, a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

Conservatory
Another academic institution, including a language training program
Vocational or other recognized nonacademic institution, other than a language training program

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.
While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa.  However, once you depart the United States you must apply for a new visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.

There is no guarantee you will be issued a visa. Do not make final travel plans or buy tickets until you have a visa.
For information about working in the United States during your study, review Students and Employment and Form I-765 Work Authorization Instructions on the USCIS website.
If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

The VCF is a required student fee that became effective and was charged to qualifying students beginning Fall 2017 semester.
The assessed fee is $350 per semester, assessed in Fall and Spring semesters only. The fee will not be assessed for study during Summer Term or Winter Intersession
The VCF will apply when you in enroll in courses for semester, provided you meet the criteria to be charged the Visa Compliance Fee at the time you register for courses.  If you are a graduate student enrolled in a 0 credit semester (continuous registration) the fee will not be added to your bill until the 11th day of the semester in which you register.
The VCF payment will be due according to the same schedule as your normal fee bill. Visit the website of the Bursar for further details.  Consequences for late payment are the same as for other fee bill balances past due.
The VCF applies to UConn students who:
1)  have a Form I-20/DS-2019 issued by the University of Connecticut for study in the term in which the fee is applicable AND
2) are active enrolled students during the semester for which the fee is applicable.
Students who finish their degree or withdraw from the University by the 10th day of the semester (add-drop deadline) for which the fee is applicable will have the fee removed/reimbursed.
Students who have a Graduate Assistantship will have the fee waived or reimbursed (if already paid), based on a collective bargaining agreement between the UConn Graduate Employee Union and the University.
Incoming J-1 exchange students who study at UConn through an exchange agreement between UConn and their home University will not be assessed the fee, as they pay tuition/fees to their home University.
 
The fee covers University expenses to provide visa sponsorship, application processing and visa advising to international students, and to maintain immigration records and meet reporting requirements to the federal government for the sponsorship of student and exchange visitor visas. These expenses include adequate staffing, training and operational costs necessary to meet federal reporting requirements and provide responsible visa sponsorship and advising to UConn international students. This fee is separate from any SEVIS or visa processing fee that international students pay directly to the U.S. government as part of the visa application process.
Yes, many other schools have either a separate fee or sometimes a separate tuition structure for international students to cover visa administration and/or support services to international students. However, the name of the fee that other schools carry may be different from “Visa Compliance Fee”.
If you are not an active student and are on post-completion OPT, you will not be required to pay the VCF. However, UConn does charge a post-completion OPT processing fee that you will be required to pay at the time of submitting your OPT application.
This depends on when your post-completion OPT will be starting. If your post-completion OPT begins during fall/spring semester, you may still be required to pay the VCF for that term, depending on your requested post-OPT start date. If your requested OPT start date is 10th day of the semester or earlier, your fee will be removed or reimbursed. If your post-OPT start date falls after 10th day of the semester, you will be responsible to pay the VCF for that semester.
If you are an active enrolled student, and UConn is maintaining an initial SEVIS record for you while your change of status is pending, then you will be assessed the VCF. If you defer your admission in the program to a later semester the VCF will be removed or reimbursed for that term in which you are not enrolled. If you defer your I-20 start date to a future semester the VCF will be removed or reimbursed for that term in which you are not seeking F-1 status.
Your Visa Compliance Fee will be removed or reimbursed.
Please contact ISSS international@uconn.edu with VCF policy questions, or the University Bursar bursar@uconn.edu with VCF billing/payment questions.

F-1 Students - International Student Services,"On This Page:
It is your responsibility to understand and comply with the terms of your immigration status during your stay in the United States. A violation of the immigration regulations (for example, failure to maintain a full-time credit load or unauthorized employment) could jeopardize your F-1 status and legal stay in the U.S. Review this information carefully and contact ISS if you have questions.
“Status” is your nonresident category officially granted by an immigration official. To be in F-1 “status” means that you are legally in the U.S. and have benefits and restrictions specified in the immigration regulations for the F-1 visa category. You gain F-1 status either by entering the U.S. with F-1 documents or, for people already in the U.S. in a different status, by applying to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for a change of status.
Your admission to the U.S. is for “duration of status,” meaning the length of your F-1 status.
F-1 status covers the period when:
Your length of authorized stay within the U.S. is not related to your F-1 visa expiration date. Your length of authorized stay depends on you following the F-1 rules.
Federal law requires you to carry “registration documents” at all times, including your I-20 and passport. We suggest that these documents be kept in a secure location such as a bank safe deposit box, and you should carry photocopies. However, if you are traveling outside the Seattle area you should carry the original documents with you. If you are traveling by air, train, bus, or ship, you may be required to produce these documents before boarding. Keep photocopies of all your documents in a separate location in the event your documents are lost or stolen.
Your passport must be valid at all times. Keep your passport and other important documents in a safe place, such as a bank safe deposit box. Report a lost or stolen passport to the police because your government may require a police report before issuing a new passport. To renew or replace your passport, contact your country’s consulate in the U.S.
The visa is the stamp that the U.S. consular officer places on a page in your passport. The visa permits you to apply for admission into the U.S. as an F-1 student, and does not need to remain valid while you are in the U.S. The F-1 visa is specifically for entry into the U.S. After you are in the U.S., the F-1 visa might expire before your status expires, or your status might end before your visa expires.
If your visa expires while you are in the U.S., the next time you travel abroad you must obtain a new F-1 visa before returning to the U.S. Visas can only be obtained outside of the U.S. at a U.S. consulate. Exceptions to this rule exist for short trips to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands. For more information, visit the Travel and Visas section.
Issued by UW, this document allows you to apply for an F-1 visa if you are outside the U.S., apply for F-1 status within the U.S., enter and reenter the U.S. in F-1 status, and prove your eligibility for various F-1 benefits. The I-20 indicates the institution in which you are permitted to study, your program of study, and the dates of eligibility. The I-20 must remain valid at all times. Allowing the I-20 to expire before you complete your academic program is a violation of F-1 status.
The I-20 is a printout from your Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record.
The I-94 is the record of your entry to the U.S. Most I-94 records are now electronic and can be accessed online.
You might need a printout of your electronic I-94 information to apply for various benefits such as a Washington State ID card or a Social Security Number. You can obtain a printout of your I-94 record on the I-94 Website.
Many kinds of updates must be reported to the Department of Homeland Security through SEVIS and must be changed on your I-20. Notify ISS of the following changes and request an updated I-20. Keep every I-20 for your permanent record, even after you graduate. Do not discard the old ones, even from previous schools. ISS files are archived and destroyed after several years, so it is your responsibility to keep your I-20s in case you need them to apply for future immigration benefits.
If you are unable to complete your course of study before the completion date noted in item 5 on your I-20, you must request an extended I-20 before your current I-20 expires. For more information and instructions, review Program Extension information.
You must register full-time at the UW since the UW issued your I-20 and oversees your SEVIS record. If you decide to transfer to another school, contact ISS prior to completing your final quarter at UW. For information about transferring your SEVIS record to the new school, visit School Transfer.
If you will complete your current program of study and plan to continue at the University of Washington in another program (for example, change from a Master’s degree program to a Ph.D. program), your I-20 must be updated. For more information, review Change of Level information.
If you are accepted into a major or if you change your major (for example, pre-major to History or History to Biology), you will be issued a new I-20.
If there is a substantial change in the source or amount of your funding, report this change to ISS and a new I-20 will be issued to you. For example, if you receive a Research or Teaching Assistantship through your department, but your I-20 indicates that you use personal funds to pay for expenses, you should request a new I-20. For more information, review Change of Funding information.
The name on your I-20 should match the name on your passport. If you change any part of your legal name—first/given name, middle name, or last/family name—on your passport, this change should be reflected on your I-20. Conversely, if you want a different name on your I-20, ISS will wait for you to change your passport first, before updating the I-20. Note that SEVIS is a separate database from the UW database. For instructions on changing your name in the UW database, visit: Name Change Policy.
In general, F-1 students must be registered full-time. This is defined as at least:
Only one online class may count towards the minimum credit amount each quarter.
Do not register for fewer than the required number of credits or withdraw from a course without first receiving permission from ISS. Part-time studies could jeopardize your stay in the U.S. and make you ineligible for F-1 benefits.
For more information and exceptions to full-time enrollment, review the Full-Time Enrollment and Exceptions information.
To maintain status, an F-1 student is also required to “make normal progress.” Making normal progress includes, but is not limited to, enrolling in the proper courses required for degree completion, maintaining satisfactory academic progress, and continually meeting all institutional enrollment requirements.
“Employment” is any work performed or services provided (including self-employment) in exchange for money or other benefit or compensation (for example, free room and board in exchange for babysitting). Unauthorized employment is taken very seriously by U.S. immigration officials; familiarize yourself with your F-1 employment eligibility options and always contact ISS before accepting any work that you are not sure is authorized.
Your spouse and unmarried children under 21 may be eligible for F-2 dependent status. Contact ISS for procedures to invite a dependent to join you in the U.S. Immigration regulations do not permit F-2 dependents to be employed in the U.S. F-2 dependents can study part-time in an academic or vocational curriculum at a SEVP-certified school. F-2 dependents can also study in avocational or recreational programs–hobbies. F-2 dependents may enroll full-time in kindergarten through 12th grade.
An F-2 dependent who wants to pursue full-time study must obtain F-1 status to begin the full-time program.
For more information on adding an F-2 dependent, review the Spouses and Children webpage.
Any change of address must be reported to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) within 10 days. Update your local address through your MyUW account, and DHS will automatically be notified of the change. If you are on OPT, submit your address change through your MyISSS portal. Please note that your local US address must be your physical address, not a P.O. Box. To update your permanent foreign address, which must be a non-U.S. address, please submit a request through MyISSS.
The end of your academic program affects your F-1 status. After you graduate or complete your program, you have a 60-day grace period.
Review the ISS Final Quarter Checklist for more information on your options during your grace period, including eligibility for work authorization, travel, commencement, inviting family members to visit the U.S., and other related issues.
If you do not complete your educational objective (for example, if you withdraw from your program), you are not eligible for the 60-day grace period. Contact your ISS adviser in this situation.
If you violate the immigration regulations you will lose your F-1 status.
However, students may be able to regain valid F-1 status either through a reinstatement application to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services or through travel and reentry with a new I-20/new SEVIS record. The appropriate option will depend on your individual circumstances; review the reinstatement and reentry procedures and consult your ISS adviser as soon as possible for more information. A scheduled appointment with your ISS adviser is required because drop-in advising will not allow sufficient time to discuss this topic. In addition, we strongly recommend that students in this situation consult with an experienced immigration attorney.

On April 2, 2024, the U.S.
While studying in the United States, it is important to maintain your F or M student status. Your status relates to the purpose, or reason for why you want to come to the United States. The U.S. Department of State issues you your visa based on your intended purpose. 
If the Department of State issues you an F or M student visa, this means that you are coming to the United States to study. You should not take any action that detracts from that purpose. Maintaining your status means:
Fulfilling the purpose for why the Department of State issued you your visa.
Following the regulations associated with that purpose.
F-1 and M-1 students share the same primary purpose for coming to the United States however, F-1 students enroll in more traditional academic programs, while M-1 students enroll in vocational programs. Because these two types of programs are different in nature, the types of benefits an international student may be eligible for and how long they may remain in the country depend on whether they are an F-1 or M-1 student.  Learn more about these specific differences by reviewing the F&M Student Status: Know the Difference infographic.
Below are actions to take in order to properly maintain your status.
When arriving to the United States, both F and M students must:
Enter the United States no more than 30 days before your program of study begins.
Immediately contact your designated school official (DSO) when you enter the United States.
When you arrive at school, you need to contact your DSO again, no later than the program start date listed on your Form I-20, ""Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.""
While studying in the United States, both F and M students must:
F-1 students must complete at least one full academic year at an SEVP-certified school to be eligible for annual vacation. Additionally, students must intend to register for classes in the academic term following their annual vacation.
SEVP-certified schools should have clear and consistent policies regarding annual vacation and comply with the requirements laid out in SEVP Policy Guidance for Adjudicators 1408-01: Academic Year.
Please note that during an annual vacation, students can take as many, as few or no courses as they want. SEVP considers all study during an annual vacation incident to status.
An F student may only work when authorized by a DSO in some cases, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in others. If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately, and you may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date. 
F students are also eligible for optional practical training during or following the program of study. OPT is a form of temporary employment that directly relates to your program of study. 
For more information about employment and training options available for F-students, visit the Working in the United States page and talk with your DSO.
M-1 students are not eligible for employment during their program of study, but may obtain authorization for practical training employment. You may participate in practical training employment after the completion of your vocational program. 
If you want to participate in practical training employment in the United States, talk with your DSO about your options. Practical training employment requires your DSO’s recommendation and authorization from USCIS. 
If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately. You may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date.
F and M students must take action to maintain legal status or depart the United States after completing your program of study.
Once you complete your program of study and any authorized period of practical training, F students have 60 days after completion of your program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. If you wish to extend your stay in the United States, talk with your DSO to learn more about doing one of the following:
Transfer to another school.
Change your education level (e.g. bachelor’s to master’s).
Apply to change status  to another visa status (e.g. H-1B-temporary worker; O-extraordinary ability in science, art or business; P-athlete).
M students have 30 days after completion of their program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. The latest date you may remain in the United States is the “admit until” date on your Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record,” unless you filed for an extension with USCIS.
If you are an F or M student studying in the United States, your DSO should be the first person you talk with if you have any questions regarding the legal requirements of your stay in the United States. Your DSO can assist in answering your questions or help you find someone who can help.
M-1 students should speak with their DSO if they are planning to do any of the following:
Take a break from school.
Travel outside the United States.
Move to a new address.
Request a program extension.
Both F and M students may contact SEVP by email at sevp@ice.dhs.gov if your DSO is unable to assist you or if you would prefer to ask someone else.
In your email, please describe your situation and include any questions you have. SEVP provides responses on a first-come, first-served basis. Answer times may vary depending on the current number of inquiries.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing.  The consular officer will inform you if this is required.
After the visa is approved, you may need to pay a visa issuance fee (if applicable to your nationality), and make arrangements for the return of the passport and visa to you.  Review the visa processing times to learn more.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.
While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa.  However, once you depart the United States you must apply for a new visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.

There is no guarantee you will be issued a visa. Do not make final travel plans or buy tickets until you have a visa.
For information about working in the United States during your study, review Students and Employment and Form I-765 Work Authorization Instructions on the USCIS website.
If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

International Student U.S. Visa Information,"

In the United States, there are three primary student visa types: F, J, and M. 
Visa Types
Valid student visas are required to apply to the Department of Homeland Security for admission into the United States at the port of entry. Students' Form I-20 document (F and M visas) or DS-2019 document (J visas), that are issued by their institution, is what allows them to maintain student status in the United States even if a visa expires during their studies. To issue I-20 or DS-2019 documentation for student visas, U.S. institutions must be certified by the Department of Homeland Security SEVP (Student and Exchange Visitor Program) (F, M visas) or designated by the Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (J visas), respectively. 
Although an institution certified by SEVP to issue I-20s (F, M visas), the institution may not hold national or regional accreditation. Recognition of course credits and degrees by other institutions and by U.S. and international employers is linked to an institution's accreditation. The U.S. Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation databases list all U.S. institutions' accreditation. Note that institutions designated by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to place participants in Academic Exchange programs (J visas) must be accredited.
Two separate U.S. government agencies manage international student arrival and status while studying in the United States. The U.S. Department of State is responsible for the initial visa application process and issuance. Once a visa holder arrives in the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then acts as the responsible agency for granting entry into the country, as well as enforcing immigration regulations that affect international students once they are in the United States.

A student visa is a travel document you receive from a U.S. consulate or embassy before you enter the United States. Your student status is what you must maintain after you are granted entrance into the United States.
Both your visa and status reflect your primary purpose for coming to the United States. As an F-1 or M-1 student, this purpose is to complete a full course of study at a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school.
U.S. consulates and embassies issue visas, and the type of student visa you receive depends on your course of study and the SEVP-certified school you attend.
However, a student visa does not guarantee entrance into the country. You must present your visa and other travel documents to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at a U.S. port of entry. A CBP officer may interview you further to determine whether or not you may enter the United States.
If you are permitted to enter the United States, the CBP officer will provide you with an admission stamp in your passport or a paper Form I-94, ""Arrival and Departure Record."" The Form I-94 includes information about when you were admitted and how long you can stay in the United States. For more information about the Form I-94 and the arrival process in the United States, visit the CBP website.
Once you are admitted into the United States, your visa may expire. However, you may remain in the country until the departure date that CBP stamped on your passport or Form I-94 as long as you maintain your status. Maintaining your status means that you perform certain actions and follow rules that help you fulfill your purpose for coming to the United States.
For an F-1 student, you will likely be admitted to the United States for a “duration of status.” This means you can stay until 60 days after your program or optional practical training end date, which is listed on your Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.”

Information for visiting international professors and researchers.
Berkeley International Office's mission is to enhance the academic experiences of international students and scholars by providing the highest levels of knowledge and expertise in advising, immigration services, advocacy, and programming to the UC Berkeley campus community.
F-1 is the most common visa status used by students in the U.S. and best fits a student's situation. Most international students at UC Berkeley have F-1 status. See F-1 Immigration Regulations to find out more about the benefits and restrictions of F-1 status.
J-1 visa status is generally used for students in specific educational exchange programs such as the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP), Fulbright, LASPAU, DAAD, AmidEast, or others. It may also be used by the university for students in degree programs. To be eligible for a J-1, students must receive a majority of their financial support from sources other than personal funds. The U.S. Department of State also requires specific health insurance coverage for J-1 students and accompanying J-2 dependents for the entirety of their stay in the U.S. See J-1 Immigration Matters to learn more about the benefits and restrictions of the J-1 student status. 
To be eligible for J-1 status, students must meet the following criteria:
Any source of financial support is acceptable.
Must show financial support for the first year of the program when requesting the initial I-20 document.
During F-1 student's degree program, Curricular Practical Training permission is available for off campus jobs/internships related to the major field of study.
Post-completion Optional Practical Training employment permission is available for a 12-month period. A job offer is not required to apply for 12-Month OPT.
An OPT extension for an additional 24 months is possible for certain STEM majors.
J-2 dependent (spouse, child) work permission is available, but not guaranteed. Income from the dependent's employment may be used to support the family's customary recreational and cultural activities and related travel, among other things. Employment will not be authorized if this income is needed to support the J-1 primary status holder. 
J-1 and J-2 dependents may be subject to the Two-Year Home Country Physical Presence Requirement
J-1 and J-2 dependents may also be subject to the 12-Month Bar depending on the length of the J program.
Note that the Two-Year Home Country Physical Presence Requirement and 12-Month Bar are separate rules.
No Two-Year Home Country Physical Presence Requirement.
No 12-Month Bar.
F-2 children may attend full-time elementary or secondary school (kindergarten-12th grade).
F-2 spouses and children may enroll in other academic programs for less than a full course of study at an SEVP-approved school. (Check with the school and their international office to be sure enrollment is less than full-time.)
F-2 spouses and children may participate in studies that are ""avocational or recreational in nature""  (i.e., non-academic hobbies and recreational studies) up to and including full-time. 
New students may already be in the U.S. with another type of nonimmigrant status. Some of these classifications allow students to attend school and some do not. Students in F-2 and B1/B2 status are not allowed to study full-time at Berkeley and must speak to a Berkeley International Office adviser about changing status. See more information under Other Visa Classifications and Changing Nonimmigrant Status .
Contact an adviser at Berkeley International Office if you have any questions about your current or future immigration status. If you think you may need to change status, talk to a Berkeley International Office adviser before you complete the NIF.
For more information about various types of nonimmigrant status, visit the U.S. Immigration and Citizenship Service (USCIS) website.

All international students attending Thiel College are in the U.S. on F-1 immigration status.
An F-1 status holder is a non-immigrant allowed to remain in the U.S. for as long as he or she is:
The primary responsibility for maintaining current F-1 status is that of each F-1 student, but the Thiel College International Student Services is here to assist with any immigration concerns or to help you answer any questions you may have.
The student is responsible for notifying the ISA office of any changes in your program or status, and for understanding the rules and responsibilities associated with your non-immigration status. You are responsible for helping us maintain your SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System) record throughout your period of stay in the United States as an F-1 student. Therefore, you must continue to provide information to the ISA office during any period as an F-1 student, including post-completion OPT. SEVIS is an inflexible system with zero tolerance for those who violate the terms of his or her student status.
To avoid issues with your immigration status:
Please email Coordinator of International Student Affairs Jackie Kytchak (jkytchak@thiel.edu) or call (724)-589-2125. We look forward to connecting with you.

"F-1 Visas for International Students: Requirements, Rules ...","Get ready to study abroad in America with our step-by-step guide to F-1 visa rules. 
Students wishing to study in the United States need to learn about the F-1 student visa application process. There are more than one million international students currently studying abroad in the USA, and with some preparation and guidance, you can join them. To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. The I-20 form provided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with your F-1 visa after graduation.
Have questions about the student visa process? Attend an upcoming Shorelight webinar > 
There are several F-1 visa rules to keep in mind if you plan to apply for a F-1 student visa. You must meet these requirements for your application to be accepted:
Institution certification—The college or the university where you plan to study needs to be approved by SEVP Immigration & Customs Enforcement.
Full-time enrollment—You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution while your academic term is in session.
English language proficiency—You must meet the required English language proficiency score of the institution you are attending or be enrolled in courses that will help you improve your English proficiency.
Sufficient funding—You must prove you have sufficient funds available to finance your studies and living expenses while in the US.
Valid passport—Your passport should be valid for US travel for at least six months after your program completion date.
Home country residency—You are required to have a residence in your home country to return to following the completion of your degree.

Before you begin your F-1 visa application, you must take the following steps:
Get accepted by a SEVP-certified institution before submitting your visa application. When you are accepted, you will receive your I-20 form, which you will need to apply for your F-1 visa.
Pay your SEVIS fee.
Complete your DS-160 visa application.
Schedule your visa interview.
Attend your visa interview.
If you are applying for a F-1 visa from India, Shorelight’s F-1 visa for Indian students guide is for you.
Once these steps are completed, you will be ready to complete and submit your F-1 student visa application. 
1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US government’s way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education. 
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay. 
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials. 
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., like getting a US driver’s license). 
Helpful resources: Confirm your US university is a SEVP-accredited institution 
Keep your Shorelight enrollment advisor updated through every step of the visa process – when you submit your application, schedule your visa interview, and, of course, when your visa application is approved.
2. Pay Your SEVIS Fee
The total cost for your F-1 student visa will be approximately $510, which includes the cost of the visa itself, plus SEVIS processing and maintenance fees. 
Requirements: Your I-20
Cost: $350 
Where to apply: Payment portal for your SEVIS fee
Make sure to save the I-901 SEVIS fee receipt. You will need it for your visa interview. 
3. Complete Your DS-160 Visa Application
Your DS-160 is your visa application. All prospective international students must complete a DS-160 to receive an F-1 visa. 
Requirements: Your I-20, passport, travel itinerary, photo for your visa
Cost: $160 
Where to apply: Application portal for your DS-160
After you successfully submit your DS-160, you will receive a printed confirmation with a barcode on it. Save this form – you will need it for your visa interview. 
4. Schedule Your Visa Interview
Find the nearest US embassy or consulate and schedule your visa interview. Wait times will vary by country and can take months — so remember to set up your appointments as early as possible!
If you are enrolling at a US university through Shorelight, ask your enrollment advisor about student visa interview tips or how to set up a mock interview session. Practicing your visa interview in advance will make you feel more comfortable with the process.
Ask your Shorelight advisor to set up a mock visa interview for you.
5. Attend Your Visa Interview
During the interview portion of the F-1 visa application process, the US consulate or embassy confirms you are coming to study as a legitimate, serious student. In your visa interview, you must also prove you have the funds to cover your time studying in the US, and confirm that you plan on returning home after your studies are complete. Attending your visa interview in person is required, though there are a few rare exceptions (e.g., if you are younger than 14 or older than 80 years of age, or if you meet certain visa renewal requirements). 
Cost: Your DS-160 payment covers the cost
Where to apply: Scheduling portal for your visa interview
After you successfully complete your visa interview, you will be granted your F-1 visa and acquire F-1 status. You are now cleared to study in the USA! 
Refer to Travel.state.gov to learn more. If you need any help with preparing or submitting your application, Shorelight provides application assistance for international students.
Before you attend your visa interview, make sure to have the following documents ready for evaluation by the consular officer:
A valid passport
A copy of the photo you will use for your visa
Printed copies of your DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmations
I-20 form
School transcript and official test scores cited on your university application
Diploma (if applicable)
Bank statements or other proof of finances
During your interview, the consular officer may request additional documents. To prepare, consider bringing the following documents:
Academic records such as transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates from schools you attended
Standardized test scores required by your US institution
Evidence of your intent to depart the United States upon completion of your course of study
Statements proving your ability to pay all educational, living, and travel costs
As an international student, you might feel uncertain about your upcoming interview. While feeling nervous is normal, do not forget to take a deep breath and remember that you are well prepared! Your interview is important, but should not be stressful.
Your interviewer will ask questions to determine: 
Are you a legitimate student?
Do you have the resources to pay for your studies?
Do you plan to return home after completing your degree?
To prepare for your F-1 student visa interview, here are some questions you might be asked: 
Why did you pick this university?
Which other US universities did you apply to?
How will you pay for your education?
Do you have relatives in the USA?
Do you plan to work while in the USA?
What do you plan to do after graduation?
Your Shorelight advisor can help you prepare for your interview by giving you a detailed overview of what the process will involve. They can also help you practice with mock interviews! Shorelight’s F-1 student visa interview guide can also help you learn more about what you can do to prepare for your upcoming interview. 
There is a possibility that your F-1 visa application will be denied. If this happens, you will be given detailed reasoning in writing, including the section of the law that led to the denial of your application.  
To avoid having your F-1 student visa application denied, it is important to read and follow all instructions carefully. Always double- and triple-check your documents before submitting your application. Shorelight advisors can offer visa assistance to make this process easier for you: They are happy to help you organize all the documents you will need, in the correct formats, and on schedule. 
Remember: During your F-1 student visa interview, you want to sufficiently demonstrate that you are traveling to the US to study and planning to return to your home country once your program is complete. Keep this in mind as you answer your interview questions.
As an international student, you must actively maintain your F-1 status to continue studying in the US. To do this, you must comply with both university regulations and codes of conduct, as well as with the requirements and conditions set out in your F-1 visa requirements. 
When entering the US:
Make sure to enter the US no more than 30 days before your program begins.
As soon as you arrive in the country, contact your designated school official (DSO).
When you arrive at your university, contact your DSO again before the start date listed on your I-20 form.
While studying in the US:
Attend all your classes and maintain good academic standing. If you require support with any of your classes, your Shorelight advisor can direct you to academic resources to help you improve.
If you need extra time to complete your program which would exceed the end date specified in your I-20, speak with your DSO to discuss your options for possible extensions.
Make sure to enroll for a full course of study when your academic term is in session.
If you want to drop a class or change classes, make sure to speak to your DSO first.
If you want to take a break and/or go on vacation, remember to first complete at least one full academic year at your institution.  After your holiday, you must also register for classes in the next academic term.
Yes, you will be able to work in the US on a F-1 student visa. However, you will have to follow certain F-1 visa rules and restrictions:
You can only work part time on campus while your academic term is in session
You can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week
You may be able to work off campus with the approval of your university
During academic breaks, you will be permitted to work full time, if your university allows it. You can learn more about working as a F-1 international student by referring to USCIS.gov.
When searching for work while you study, make sure to seek approval from your DSO first. 
Keep in mind, once you finish your program, you will have a grace period of 60 days to leave the US. If you wish to extend your stay, you can speak to a Shorelight advisor to explore your options, such as transferring to another school or pursuing further education.

How to Determine if You Are an International Student,"International students are defined as ""non-immigrant"" visitors who come to the United States temporarily to take classes or take online courses virtually from anywhere in the world. A non-immigrant is someone who meets one or more of the following criteria:
Most international students attending UC Berkeley Summer Sessions have an F-1 student visa. Other visa statuses (e.g., H4, L2) may permit study. Please review the Berkeley International Office Do You Need a Student Visa? webpage to determine if you need visa documents from UC Berkeley.

F1 Visa Renewal - Step by Step Guide - Visa Guide,"In this article

Complete guide to renewing and extending an F1 visa
In this article
As a foreign national you can study in the US with an F-1 student visa. If your student visa expires before your program is over, you may be eligible for an F-1 visa renewal. To renew your F-1 student visa you have to re-apply for the visa from your home country, or another country, at a US embassy or consulate (applying from your country is always preferable).
You only need to renew your visa if you plan on leaving and returning to the US because if your student visa expires, but your Form 1-20 is still valid you can continue your studies. However, you never know when you might need to travel so it’s always good to renew your F-1 visa instead of staying with an expired one. Here you can read all the details about applying for a visa renewal, what other renewing options are available, and you can extend your F-1 visa.
To renew your F-1 visa, you have to follow the same steps you did when you initially applied for the visa:
After you apply for your F-1 visa renewal, you have to stay in the country from where you applied until your application is processed and you cannot travel to the US. If your application for renewal is denied, you have to return home.
Keep in mind that while you may apply for a renewal of your F-1 visa from another country other than your country of residence, it’s always advisable to apply from home since that will make the application process easier for you and the embassy/consulate.
You need to prepare the same documents that were required for your initial F-1 visa application and add some additional documents:
One other way you can renew your F-1 visa without having to apply again is through automatic visa renewal. Automatic renewal means that you can travel to Canada, Mexico, or other US territories for less than 30 days, and when you re-enter the US your visa is automatically renewed.
If you want to use this option, then make sure you plan your travel ahead of time before your visa expires or just after it has expired, and make sure you check whether you need a visa to enter Canada. Once you return, the border patrol officer will validate your status as a student and your F-1 visa is renewed for the remainder of your study program.
If your visa is about to expire while you are abroad, then you can renew your visa before it expires if you want to re-enter the country. Usually, you have to wait for your visa to expire and then renew it.
Your new F-1 visa is issued for another year. This is usually the maximum validity period that US embassies or consulates issue F-1 visas with, but if you need to stay longer to finish your program, you can apply for another renewal when your current visa expires.
Once your academic program and OPT are over, you have 60 days to leave the US and go back to your home country. During your application period, you had to submit proof that you plan to return home once you were done with the program.
However, there are a few ways through which you can try to stay in the US even if the F1 visa will no longer be valid and you will not be able to extend it. The only solution is to change your status.
The easiest route that most F1 visa students follow is to get an H-1B visa sponsorship. This changes your status to a nonimmigrant visa and you can stay and work in the US for up to 6 years.
The benefit of the H-1B visa though is that it is a dual intent visa. This means that after 6 years, you can also try to petition and get a Green Card. This will be an Employment-Based Green Card which will allow you to live and work in the US permanently.
If you could not get an employer to sponsor you for an H-1B visa, you can either return to your home country or try more complicated options.
One option is to self-petition for an Employment-Based Green Card. You can make your case that you have extraordinary abilities in the arts, science, business, or athletics and get an EB-1 visa. This is extremely difficult and most of these petitions fail because of extensive requirements.
The second option is to become a US investor. You can invest in a US commercial enterprise and create jobs. This could make a case that you are contributing to the economic development of the US and you might get an Investor Green Card or EB-5 visa.
The difficulty in getting this visa is that the requirement for the amount of the investment is too large. You must invest between $500K and $1 million in the commercial enterprise to qualify for an EB-5 visa. As a student who was on an F1 visa until that point, it is highly unlikely that you will have that amount of money saved.
The final route is to marry a US citizen. A lot of F1 visa students meet someone and start a relationship with that person which leads to marriage. Once engaged, the F1 visa student would qualify for a fiancé visa and after marriage, they get the IR-1 visa. The IR-1 visa is the spouse of a US citizen visa and it allows you to live and work in the US permanently.
This option is easier than the two previous ones, but you must be careful to not create a fake relationship. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) requires extensive proof of your relationship to the US citizen. They do this to prevent fake Green Card marriages.
You will have to know the person you are in a relationship with and prove that you have been together for some time. Additionally, once you are married, you need to provide proof that the marriage was legal. You will have to submit your marriage certificate, declarations from your ceremony witnesses, pictures of the wedding, and receipts from your wedding reception or honeymoon.
You can also extend your F-1 visa if you want to. The process for extension is a bit different than renewing your visa. To extend your visa, usually you have to complete a post-graduation OPT (Optional Practical Training).
An OPT is a work program you can do while on your student visa. You can do the program during your studies or after you finish your studies, but if you want to extend your visa, you should do the work program after your studies are over.
You can work for 12 months under a US employer, part-time or full-time. When your work is finished after 12 months, your employer can sponsor you for an H-1B visa and you can change your status.
Keep in mind that if you are a STEM student, you can extend your OPT for up to 24 months.

Renewing Your F-1 Visa: Applying for a Visa: F-1 Students,"


IUPUI

If your visa stamp has expired and you need to travel outside of the United States, you may need to renew your visa stamp in order to return.
It is important to remember there is a distinction made between your F-1 visa stamp and your F-1 visa status. F-1 students are admitted to the United States for the duration of their status, not for a specific amount of time. This is why an F-1 student's I-94 ""admit until"" date should read ""D/S.""
If an F-1 student is maintaining their status in the United States they do not need to renew their visa stamp to stay in the U.S. This means you may remain even after your visa stamp expiration date if you are maintaining your F-1 status. Find out more about maintaining your F-1 status on our website. If your visa stamp has expired and you travel outside of the U.S. you will need to renew your visa to re-enter the U.S. in F-1 status.
You may only renew your F-1 visa at a U.S. embassy or consular office outside of the United States. Contact the U.S. embassy/consulate, generally in your home country, to set up an appointment. The wait time for an appointment and for visa issuance varies. To see how long this process takes in your country, read the U.S. Department of State's visa wait time information.
It’s best to apply in your home country. If you are not sure which embassy/consulate you should contact, see this list of U.S. embassies.
When you arrive for your visa appointment, you will be required to show a number of documents, including:
Since you are applying for a nonimmigrant visa, you will need to prove to the consular officer that you do not intend to immigrate to the United States. In other words, you need to show him or her that you have definite plans to return home after college.
For more information and tips, please see NAFSA's Ten Points to Remember.
Generally, it can be more difficult to renew your F-1 visa stamp while on OPT. OIA would not recommend attempting to renew your F-1 visa stamp while on OPT if you are not currently employed. Please feel free to contact an advisor at the Office of International Affairs if you have questions.
Applying for visa in a country which is not your home country or the U.S., called a “third” country, can be more difficult than applying at home. You should have a valid reason for applying in the country where the consulate is located; you are likely to be denied if your only reason for applying in that country is to avoid your home country consulate. Examples of valid reasons could include to attend a conference, to visit family or friends, etc.
Additionally, you may need to prove that you have continuously maintained lawful non-immigrant status during your time in the U.S. or you may be sent to your home country to apply for the visa. Refusal in a third country is more likely than at home, so you should plan well in advance of your date of travel.
The U.S. Department of State provides specific guidance on applying for a visa in Canada or Mexico. If you intend to apply for a new U.S. visa in either country and are not a citizen or resident of either country, it is important for you to  contact an advisor at the Office of International Affairs if you have further questions.

If you plan to take a trip outside the United States (U.S.) or return to your home country for a temporary visit, you must confirm that you will have the proper visa documents to return to the U.S. If your visa stamp will be expired at the time of your reentry to the U.S., you must budget time while outside the U.S. to renew the visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in your country. You cannot renew a visa stamp inside the U.S. The process of renewing a visa is almost the same as applying for the initial visa because each visa application is considered an independent application.
It is not possible to apply for or renew non-immigrant visas inside the U.S. You must apply for a visa in a U.S. embassy or consulate outside the U.S. You may check the estimated visa processing time on the web site of the specific U.S. embassy or consulate where you plan to apply for your visa. Wait times may vary considerably among consular posts, and processing times indicated may not be accurate. Please see below for details.
In general, you will need the following in order to return to the U.S.:
*If you will need a travel signature, please note the following information regarding how to obtain a travel signature:
You should check your documents prior to making international travel plans. Note that it is also recommended that you take your visa documents for domestic travel outside the Boston metropolitan area. It is possible that a government official may request to see them even if you are staying within the U.S. when you travel.

Renewing Your F-1 Visa,"Entry visas can only be issued outside of the United States.
We recommend that you apply for your new visa in your home country.
We also strongly encourage you to schedule an appointment in advance before you leave the U.S. and also double check the U.S. embassy website in your country to see if there are other documents
that they will require of you.
It depends on how much risk you want to assume in the visa renewal process. Many students
wish to travel to Canada or Mexico to apply for a new visa because they are so close
to the United States. Before you decide to do this, please review the following information.

F-1 Visa Renewal | F-1 Student Status,"F-1 students (except citizens of Canada) are required to have valid, unexpired F-1 entry visas in order to enter the United States as F-1 students.
You are required to have a valid F-1 entry visa for the purpose of entering the U.S. in F-1 status. However, once you are in the U.S., the expiration of your F-1 visa has no bearing on your eligibility to stay. You may remain in the U.S. as long as you have a valid and unexpired I-20, an I-94 card marked 'F-1, D/S,' and are making full-time progress toward the degree objective indicated on your I-20.
Before leaving on a trip outside the U.S., check the expiration date of your visa and the number of entries you are allowed. If your visa has expired or will expire while you are abroad, you may need to renew it while you are abroad. Short trips (30 days or less) to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean (except Cuba) do not require an unexpired F-1 visa for re-entry into the U.S.
You cannot obtain a new visa while in the United States. Visas are issued only at U.S. consulates outside of the U.S. In order to obtain a new F-1 visa, you must carry with you: 
To confirm the requirements and procedure for applying for renewal of an F-1 visa, consult the embassy/consulate where you will be applying. Most consulates post current information on their website. Go to USEmbassy.gov for a list of consular websites worldwide. Additional information about F and J visas can be found on the Study & Exchange page of the U.S. Department of State website.
Please be sure to plan carefully. Visa appointments and application procedures vary from consulate to consulate, and waiting times vary depending on the time of year. We recommend that students renew their U.S. visa in their home country, but if you are planning to renew your visa in a third country, please see the section below.  
It is not always possible to renew your U.S. visa in a third country (i.e., a country that is not your country of citizenship or legal permanent residence). Some U.S. consulates do not accept visa applications from ""third country nationals"" at certain busy times of the year. (For example, the U.S. Embassy in Paris may not accept applications from non-French citizens during the summer.) If you choose to apply for a visa in a third country, make sure to check your eligibility by contacting the US Embassy or Consulate directly. 
Also, if you apply for a U.S. visa in Canada or Mexico and your application is denied, you will not be allowed to re-enter the U.S. If your visa is denied, you will need to return to your home country to renew your visa. Discuss plans to apply for a visa in a country other than your own with one of the International Student Advisors at the OISS.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security started charging a I-901 SEVIS fee in September 2004. Currently the fee is $350 for F-1 students. Students may or may not be required to pay the fee, depending on the following criteria:
Since individual situations may vary, contact the OISS at tcintl@tc.columbia.edu with specific information about your F-1 history so that we may help you determine whether or not you are subject to the I-901 SEVIS fee.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.
Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.
While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa.  However, once you depart the United States you must apply for a new visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.

There is no guarantee you will be issued a visa. Do not make final travel plans or buy tickets until you have a visa.
For information about working in the United States during your study, review Students and Employment and Form I-765 Work Authorization Instructions on the USCIS website.
If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

How to Renew and Extend the F | 1 Student Visa?,"Foreigners who want to study in the United States need an F-1 visa to achieve this objective. The F-1 visa holder can stay in the United States to attend the university/college. However, they can’t live in the country after their visa expires. The F-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa that doesn’t allow people to stay in the U.S. permanently. However, it might be possible to get a visa extension on genuine grounds. This article will describe the F-1 visa renewal process and tips to get an extension.
 
 
The U.S. Embassy in your home country will issue an F-1 visa for the duration of your academic program provided that you fulfill the F-1 visa requirements. If it is going to take you 2 years to complete your academic program, you’re likely to get the visa for 2 years. It’s also possible that you get the visa for one year and you have to renew it after one year. However, if something changes and you need to stay longer than the allowed time period, you can apply to renew your F-1 visa.
 
You can stay in the country with an expired visa provided that you have a valid Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status. However, it’s advisable to renew your visa rather than staying in the country with an expired visa. Here are two ways you can get a renewal:
 
 
Note: It’s not possible to get the F-1 visa renewal if your academic program has concluded and there is no valid reason why you should stay in the U.S. after your visa expires.
 
 
You can apply for F-1 visa renewal after you leave the United States. There is a process every applicant has to follow. It’s advisable to apply for the renewal from your home country as your chances of getting a visa renewal decrease when applying from other countries. If your F-1 visa renewal application has been rejected, you can’t enter the U.S. even if your academic program is still in progress.
 
You have to start the process by filing Form DS-160, Online Application for Nonimmigrant Visa. You will receive a confirmation page after completing and submitting the form. You might not need to schedule or attend the interview again for visa renewal.
 
However, you have to provide the documents supporting why you need a visa renewal. The documents you submit must be sufficient to establish that you truly deserve a visa renewal. Here are some of the documents that can strengthen your case and get you approval:
 
 
There is a waiting time after you submit the document for review. You will get a notification from the U.S. Embassy. If your request for renewal is approved, you can travel to or stay in the U.S. to complete your program.
 
 
Automatic visa revalidation is another way to renew your F-1 visa. It allows students to visit Mexico, Canada, or the U.S. territories for less than 30 days and get their F-1 visa automatically renewed upon their entry to the U.S. You can plan to visit these countries before or after your visa expires. If you need a visa to enter these countries, obtain it before your F-1 visa expires. You can stay in one of the mentioned countries for 30 days or return to the U.S. immediately.
 
You’ll get a visa revalidation after the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials examine your documents. The revalidation will allow you to stay in the U.S. for the period you’re enrolled in your academic program. You can read our article about Automatic Visa Revalidation to learn more about your options.
 
 
There are certain ways you can extend your F-1 visa beyond its validity. Optional Practical Training (OPT) is one of the opportunities you can get a visa extension beyond your academic program. OPT allows F-1 visa holders to work in the United States for a year. You can use this opportunity during or after your program ends.
 
You can work part-time or full-time for an employer in the U.S. Once your OPT is over, your employer might consider sponsoring you for an H-1B visa, or you can extend your OPT for another 12 months in some cases. For most F-1 holders, when their OPT is over and their visa expired, there is no way they can get an extension.
 
 
An F-1 visa holder has 60 days to leave the United States once your academic program is completed and OPT is over as well. Typically, it’s not possible to stay in the U.S. when the visa expires and you have to return home. However, there are some cases in which you can stay in the U.S. even if your F-1 visa has expired or you’re no longer able to extend it. Changing your status is the solution. Here are your options when it comes to changing your status:
 
 
Getting an H-1B visa sponsorship is probably an easy way for F-1 visa holders to change their status to a nonimmigrant visa and extend their stay in the United States for up to 6 years. H-1B is a dual intent visa, which means you can attempt to get a green card after 6 years. This is going to be an employment-based green card that will allow you to stay and work in the U.S. permanently. 
 
If any employer in the U.S. is not willing to sponsor you for an H-1B visa, you can consider returning to your home country or you may try other complicated ways to get a visa extension. Self-petition for an employment-based immigrant visa is also an option. A successful demonstration of your capabilities in science, arts, business, etc. can get you an EB-1 visa. However, it’s difficult to get success with these options due to a number of rigid requirements.
 
 
If you have the resources to invest in the U.S. economy, you might qualify to get an Investor Green Card or EB-5 visa which will allow you to stay in the U.S. permanently. To avail this option, you have to make a considerable contribution towards economic development in the U.S. The only issue with this option is the minimum requirement for the amount of investment. To qualify for an EB-5 visa, you have to invest between $500K and $1 million. Students usually don’t have this much money. However, if you have resources, you may consider this option.
 
 
Marrying a U.S. citizen might enable you to change your status. There are many cases where F-1 visa holders start a relationship with a U.S. citizen which often leads to marriage. If you’re planning to marry a U.S. citizen, it will make you eligible for the IR-1 visa which is for the spouse of a U.S. citizen. This option seems easier than the above-mentioned ways. However, getting an IR-1 visa involves complexities and extensive process. Since many people try to create a fake relationship to get a green card, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) requires solid proof of your relationship.
 
You can produce many supporting documents to ensure the USCIS that your relationship is not fake. Marriage certificates, pictures, declarations from ceremony witnesses, or anything that strengthens your relationship being genuine should be provided.

Renewing Your U.S. Visa | Travel Information for Students ...,"To enter the U.S., all international students, with the exception of those from Canada, must have a valid F-1/J-1 visa upon arrival at a U.S. port of entry.
If your visa has expired and you do need to travel outside of the U.S. and re-enter to continue your studies, you will need to re-new your visa. You can re-new your visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in your home country.  You are not able to obtain a new visa from within the U.S. 
Visa processing times vary from country to country.  We recommend that you contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate where you plan to apply to learn about the visa application process.
NOTE:  Please see temporary guidance on visa interview requirements through 12/21/2023.
We recommend that you present the following documents when you apply for an F-1/J-visa: 
Valid Passport (valid for at least 6 months into the future)
Your Form I-20/DS-2019 (with a valid travel signature)
Enrollment Verification Letter 
Evidence of Financial Support-You will need financial documents which provide proof of sufficient funds for at least one academic year as specified on your Form I-20 / DS-2019.  You can present various documents as evidence of financial support.
Scholarship/Financial Aid Letter- If you are receiving funding from Brandeis, you must have an up to date letter from Student Financial Services or your department which specifies the amount and conditions of your scholarship, fellowship, loan or financial assistance.
Bank Statements-If you are funded by personal or family funds, you must have a bank statement in your name or a bank statement with a letter from your financial sponsor/account holder.
F-1 visa applicants must demonstrate ""nonimmigrant intent.""  Be prepared to answer questions about your plans to return home following the completion of your degree.
If you travel outside of the U.S. during your OPT or STEM OPT period, after your F-1 visa has expired , you will need to renew your F-1 visa before returning to the U.S.  Remember, OPT/STEM OPT is an extension of your F-1 status.
We recommend that you present the following documents when you apply for an F-1 visa: 
We recommend checking the website of your local U.S. Embassy or Consulate to see if they have additional required documentation for visa renewal.
F-1 visa applicants must demonstrate ""nonimmigrant intent"", even while on OPT.  Be prepared to answer questions about your plans to return home following the completion of your practical training.
Applying for a visa in a country which is not your home country (called a ""third country"") can be more difficult than applying at home. It may take more time to apply for a visa in a third country, and there is a higher risk of denial. If your visa application is denied by a consular officer in a third country, you must return to your home to apply for a new visa before you can return to the U.S. in student status.
The ISSO recommends that international students seeking to renew their visas do so in their home countries if possible.
The Department of State (DOS) may delay the issuance of visas to some students due to the need for further time for additional review and/or security clearances.  This is called ""Administrative Processing"" and it takes place after the visa interview. The student should receive a 221(g) letter indicating that their visa application is subject to further administrative processing. 
The duration of the administrative processing will vary based on the individual circumstances of each case. Visa applicants are reminded to apply early for their visas, well in advance of the anticipated travel date.
It is impossible to know which applications will require additional processing. However, additional processing is more common among applicants:
If you suspect your application may require administrative processing, we recommend that you request a letter from your department to offer additional details about your program or work in the United States. This letter may include:
The letter should be written in English, with limited use of technical terminology or jargon. You may present this letter at the time of the visa interview, as needed. While  a letter will not prevent your application from being subject to security clearance, the letter may help to provide information and speed processing along. Once a security clearance is granted, it remains valid for up to four years for subsequent visa renewals.
While this may not prevent administrative processing, it could result in a quicker resolution of your case.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

You and your school official must sign the Form I-20.  All students must be registered in the Student and Exchange Visitor System (SEVIS). Your spouse and/or minor children, if they intend live in the United States with you, will each receive an individual Form I-20.


Gather and prepare the following required documents before your visa interview:
A consular officer will interview you to determine your qualifications for a student visa, and may request additional documents, such as evidence of:

Your academic preparation, such as:
Transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates from schools you attended; and
Standardized test scores required by your U.S. school;


Your intent to depart the United States upon completion of the course of study; and
How you will pay all educational, living and travel costs. 

Review the instructions for how to apply for a visa on the website of the U.S. Embassy or Consulate where you will apply.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.
While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa.  However, once you depart the United States you must apply for a new visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.

There is no guarantee you will be issued a visa. Do not make final travel plans or buy tickets until you have a visa.
For information about working in the United States during your study, review Students and Employment and Form I-765 Work Authorization Instructions on the USCIS website.
If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.

Congratulations on your decision to study in the United States. Nonimmigrant students who come to the United States to study must follow specific rules. However, different rules apply depending on your student type and education level. Learn what student type and education level applies to you below:
Student Type:
Education Level:

Your first step is to apply to a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school in the United States. Use the School Search tool to find SEVP-certified schools and programs that are eligible to enroll F-1 and M-1 students. For more information about the types of programs that are available to you, please visit EducationUSA.
If you are a student currently enrolled in the equivalent of a kindergarten through grade 12 program, visit the Kindergarten to Grade 12 page on Study in the States.
The Form I-20
Once you are accepted into an SEVP-certified school, your school’s designated school official will send you a document called the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” The Form I-20 is a paper record of your information in our Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) database. Each school that accepts you will mail you a Form I-20.
For more information, visit the Students and the Form I-20 page.
After receiving your Form I-20, you must pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee.
Federal regulations require all F, M and J students pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee before applying for their U.S. student visa. You can pay your I-901 SEVIS Fee online at FMJfee.com or by using Western Union Quick Pay. You must present the receipt as proof of payment when you apply for visa. It’s important that the SEVIS ID number on your I-901 SEVIS Fee receipt matches your SEVIS ID number on your Form I-20. If it does not, or you encounter other issues paying your fee, please contact SEVP.
I-901 SEVIS Fee Assistance:
Learn more about the I-901 SEVIS Fee:
After paying the I-901 SEVIS Fee and getting a receipt, you must apply for a visa at any U.S. Embassy or Consulate before you come to the United States.
To receive a visa, you will have to participate in an in-person interview. During your visa interview, you will need to establish that you meet the requirements under U.S. law to receive the category of visa for which you are applying. The consular officer will determine if you qualify to receive a visa and which visa category is appropriate based on your purpose of travel.
A visa does not guarantee entrance to the United States; it only permits you to arrive and seek permission to enter the country. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the U.S. port of entry has the final authority to admit entry into the country.
The following pages will assist with this process:
Before you leave for the United States, familiarize yourself with the different documents you will need or could need when you arrive. It is also a good idea to make at least two sets of copies of these documents: one copy to leave with your family before you depart and one copy to give to your school officials. Required documents include your:
It is also smart to have your acceptance letter, proof of financial ability and any other supporting documentation with you, in case the Customs and Border Protection officer asks for them. You should carry your original travel documents on you at all times while traveling. Do not put them in your checked baggage. For more information on traveling to the United States, visit the Getting to the United States page.
When you arrive to the United States you will meet a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry, who will verify your information and determine if you may enter the country.
If the officer cannot initially verify your information, or if you do not have all of the required documentation, you may be directed to an interview area known as “secondary inspection.” Secondary inspection allows inspectors to conduct additional research in order to verify information without causing delays for other arriving passengers.
The inspector will first attempt to verify your status by using SEVIS. In the event that the CBP officer needs to verify information with your school or program, we strongly recommend that you have the name and telephone number of the designated school official (DSO) at your school on hand. If you arrive during non-business hours (evening, weekends, holidays), you should also have an emergency or non-business hour phone number available for this official.
Failure to comply with U.S. government entry-exit procedures may result in your being denied entry to the United States. Under certain circumstances, the CBP officer may issue a Form I-515A, “Notice to Student or Exchange Visitor,” which authorizes temporary admission into the United States. Work with your school without delay to submit the proper documentation required by the Form I-515A. Failing to comply with a Form I-515A will result in the termination of your status. Read SEVP’s Form I-515A Noncompliance Termination procedure to ensure you understand how to properly respond and maintain your status.
If the CBP officer admits you into the country, you will be given a Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record.” This form shows that you have been legally admitted into the United States, the class of admission and your authorized period of stay. It is very important that the information on the record is correct. Inconsistencies between the information on the Form I-94 and SEVIS records can reduce the chances of a successful systems interface and can result in denial of benefits or difficulty re-entering the country.
You have 30 days to enter the country before your official program start date, as listed on your Form I-20. If you do not report to your school by your program start date, your DSO may terminate your SEVIS record. We suggest that you contact your school immediately once you enter the country so that there is no question of your arrival.
If you cannot enter the United States for the term listed on your Form I-20, contact your school officials as soon as possible so that they can update your record so your plans are accurately reflected in SEVIS.
As an F or M student, you will often hear the phrase “maintaining status.” Maintaining your status means that you are fulfilling the purpose for why the U.S. Department of State issued you your visa and following the regulations associated with that purpose. Remember, a student visa is a travel document you receive from a U.S. consulate or embassy before you enter the United States. Your student status is what you must maintain after you are granted entrance into the United States. Learn more about the rules you must follow by talking to your DSO and reviewing the Maintaining Status page on Study in the States.
While studying in the United States, you may be eligible to apply for certain benefits. These student benefits are not granted by SEVP and require students to apply to other government agencies to receive them. The benefits you are eligible for will depend on your student status. Visit the following pages to learn more about potential student benefits:
As a note, most employment and training opportunities require authorization from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). For more information, visit the Employment page on ICE.gov.
If you are having an immediate problem and need assistance quickly, please speak with your DSO or responsible officer. If that person cannot help you, contact the SEVP Response Center at 1-703-603-3400 or at SEVP@ice.dhs.gov.
Once you have completed your program and fulfilled your purpose for coming to the United States, you may have a number of options. These include changing your status, applying for training, transferring to another SEVP-certified school or leaving the country.
Please note there are restrictions that apply to M-1 students regarding transferring and changing status. Talk to your DSO to understand what your options are.
If after your program is complete you do not qualify to stay in the country, or chose to depart, please be advised:
You can also visit USCIS to learn about naturalization and the path to U.S. citizenship.

"The F-1 Student Visa, Explained","Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
What is the F-1 visa?
The F-1 visa allows a student to temporarily live in the United States for a defined period of time while studying at a school, college, seminary, or conservatory.
Is the F-1 visa right for me?
For many students, the chance to study in the United States is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. Unless the person is already a U.S. citizen or green card holder, all prospective students will have to apply for a visa to study in the United States.
Because there are so many courses and places to study in the United States, the F-1 visa has a pretty broad application but also some very clear rules. The first is that you have to be coming to the United States with the intent to temporarily study. In other words, this is not an immigrant visa.
You must be studying at an academic institution, not training at a vocational school, as this will require an M-1 visa. Your academic institution must be approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning it needs to be accredited to be able to accept foreign students on F-1 visas.
You will be able to work, but because this is a non-immigrant visa, you will be restricted to where you can work and the type of work. Finally, although your spouse and children can come with you, they will not be able to work but your children can enroll in schools. They will be on F-2 visas and tied to your visa’s status.
Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have. Learn more about what we do to help.
The requirements for an F-1 visa are:
For many students, the process of applying and being accepted into a U.S. academic institution is the lengthiest part. The visa process is a series of steps that take place after you accept an enrollment offer. Not sure if you qualify for an F-1 student visa? Start by checking your eligibility.
Congratulations, you have been accepted into a course of study by a U.S. academic institution! Years of hard work probably led you to this milestone, so here’s the process to obtain your student visa.
After your SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be added to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVP uses SEVIS to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M, and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.
Once you have registered with SEVIS, you will need to pay the I-901 fee. This fee is currently $350 for most people, and funds the SEVP program.
Your SEVP-approved school will then issue you a Form I-20. This form is incredibly important as it confirms your acceptance at the school, and therefore your eligibility for the F-1 visa. Once this Form I-20 has been issued, you will be able to apply to a U.S. embassy or consulate for your F-1 visa.
The steps required will vary between different U.S. embassies or consulates, so make sure you check their websites for further information.
However, you must complete the Form DS-160, which is similar to the Form DS-260 for immigrant visas. The form is very detailed and can take some time to fill in, so make sure you set aside plenty of time to complete it.
Once you have completed the Form DS-160, you will need to schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, unless you are under 13 years of age or over 80 years of age. The U.S. Department of State says you should schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country where you live. You may schedule your interview at another U.S. embassy or consulate, but be aware that it may be more difficult to qualify for a visa outside of the country where you live.
Prior to your interview, you will need to pay the $185 application fee and also, depending on your nationality, pay an issuance fee, as well. The visa issuance fee is only due after your interview, if your visa is approved. The next step will be an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate.
Visa wait times can vary depending on the time of year and location. You can use the appointment wait time tool to see how long you will have to wait for an appointment at a specific U.S. embassy or consulate.
At this stage, it is important to note that F-1 visas for new students can only be issued up to 365 days (one year) in advance of the start date for a course of study. It used to be 120 days, but in February, 2023, the State Department extended the period.
Note: For existing F-1 visas, this is not the case and visas can be issued any time, as long as the student is currently enrolled at a SEVP-approved school or institution and in SEVIS.
Boundless not only makes it easy for you to complete your F-1 student visa application, but we can also help you get ready for your visa interview. Learn more about what you get with Boundless.
You will generally be required to attend an interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate. You will need to bring:
You should also be prepared to bring evidence of:
During your interview, the consular officer will ask you questions to determine whether or not to approve your F-1 visa. Make sure you are complete and accurate in your answers, as you will be under oath. For interview tips, see the Boundless guide on preparing for the F-1 student visa interview.
The consular officer will also take your fingerprints, although this will vary depending on your location. After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing. The consular officer will let you know if this is required.
Once your interview is complete, you will be informed of the outcome and, if successful, be issued a visa to study in the United States.

Yes, you can bring your spouse and children with you. Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
F-1 students cannot work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students can engage in three types of off-campus employment:
This depends on your individual taxation situation, but typically you might be required to file a U.S. tax return. For more information, seek advice from a qualified tax professional.
Generally, an F-1 student may transfer between SEVP-certified schools. However, this does involve paperwork and coordination. See here for more detailed instructions.
There are some programs and visas available for F-1 visa holders after you finish studying in the United States. These can be highly individual to your circumstances, field of study, and professional background, so do your research carefully.

You don’t have to navigate the F-1 student visa process alone. Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have along the way. Learn more about what we do to help.

USCIS Issues New Guidance on F and M Student Visa ...,"Quick Hits
The updated policy guidance for F and M student classifications consolidates and clarifies existing policy into one cohesive document in an effort to provide clarity to international students and U.S. educational institutions. The guidance covers topics including the agency’s role in adjudicating applications for employment authorization, change of status, extension of stay, and reinstatement of status for students and their dependents in the United States.
In order to be eligible for F and M student classifications, students must intend to depart from the United States following their temporary periods of stay, typically following the end of the degree program and any period of practical training. Students must maintain a foreign residence that they do not intend to abandon. Notably, the policy guidance clarifies that F and M students may be the beneficiary of a permanent labor certification application or immigrant visa petition and still be able to demonstrate their intent to depart after a temporary period of stay. Having a pending or approved labor certification application or immigrant visa petition will not necessarily impact a student’s eligibility for these classifications. USCIS officers will consider all facts when determining if a student has demonstrated eligibility.
In the employment context, the guidance clarifies that an F-1 student seeking the two-year science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) optional practical training (OPT) extension may be employed by a start-up business provided that the start-up adheres to the regulatory requirements, including complying with training plan requirements and maintaining good standing with E-Verify. The guidance also clarifies that alternative compensation may be permitted during the STEM OPT extension as long as the F-1 student can demonstrate “they are a bona fide employee and that their compensation … is commensurate with the compensation provided to other similarly situated U.S. workers.”
Key Takeaways
The policy guidance offers new clarity for students and U.S. educational institutions with regard to the considerations made by officers when determining eligibility for F and M student classifications and when assessing options for employment.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is issuing policy guidance regarding the F and M student nonimmigrant classifications, including the agency’s role in adjudicating applications for employment authorization, change of status, extension of stay, and reinstatement of status for these students and their dependents in the United States.
This guidance consolidates existing policy. USCIS expects that this will provide welcome clarity to international students and U.S. educational institutions on a wealth of topics, including eligibility requirements, school transfers, practical training, and on- and off-campus employment.
For example, the guidance clarifies that F and M students must have a foreign residence that they do not intend to abandon, but that such students may be the beneficiary of a permanent labor certification application or immigrant visa petition and may still be able to demonstrate their intention to depart after a temporary period of stay.
In addition, the guidance specifies how F students seeking an extension of optional practical training (OPT) based on their degree in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field may be employed by startup companies, as long as the employer adheres to the training plan requirements, remains in good standing with E-Verify, and provides compensation commensurate to that provided to similarly situated U.S. workers, among other requirements.
The nonimmigrant academic student (F-1) classification allows a noncitizen to enter the United States as a full-time student at a college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution, or in a language training program. The nonimmigrant vocational student (M-1) classification includes students in established vocational or other recognized nonacademic programs, other than language training programs.

International Student U.S. Visa Information,"
Jump to navigation


In the United States, there are three primary student visa types: F, J, and M. 
Visa Types
Valid student visas are required to apply to the Department of Homeland Security for admission into the United States at the port of entry. Students' Form I-20 document (F and M visas) or DS-2019 document (J visas), that are issued by their institution, is what allows them to maintain student status in the United States even if a visa expires during their studies. To issue I-20 or DS-2019 documentation for student visas, U.S. institutions must be certified by the Department of Homeland Security SEVP (Student and Exchange Visitor Program) (F, M visas) or designated by the Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (J visas), respectively. 
Although an institution certified by SEVP to issue I-20s (F, M visas), the institution may not hold national or regional accreditation. Recognition of course credits and degrees by other institutions and by U.S. and international employers is linked to an institution's accreditation. The U.S. Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation databases list all U.S. institutions' accreditation. Note that institutions designated by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to place participants in Academic Exchange programs (J visas) must be accredited.
Two separate U.S. government agencies manage international student arrival and status while studying in the United States. The U.S. Department of State is responsible for the initial visa application process and issuance. Once a visa holder arrives in the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then acts as the responsible agency for granting entry into the country, as well as enforcing immigration regulations that affect international students once they are in the United States.

Student Visas Allowing Foreign Nationals to Legally Enter ...,"
	Every year, a number of people from around the world come to the United States for educational purposes. There are specific federal requirements that foreign students must adhere to in order to apply for a student visa. There are several types of visas that a student may pursue, depending on his or her specific circumstances, including F Student Visas, M Student Visas, and J Visas for Exchange Visitors.


	Student visas may require an in-person interview before being approved. Additionally, a person applying for a student visa must meet a number of other criteria to obtain a student visa. These include full-time enrollment at an institution approved by the USCIS, a sufficient amount of money for self-support for the entire duration of the educational program, proficiency in English, and more.

F visas = foreign national academic students
M visas = foreign national vocational students
J visas = foreign nationals participating in educational and cultural exchanges

	To enter the United States to attend a university or college, high school, private elementary school, seminary, conservatory, or another academic institution, including a language training program, an individual can seek an F visa. The “F” visa is a non-immigrant visa. The F-1 visa is the most common type of student visa in the United States. F-1 students are not permitted to seek employment in the U.S., except for part-time work on campus. Part-time work means less than 20 hours per week. Full-time work is permissible during school recess periods. After the F-1 student completes his or her educational training, the individual may be able to seek practical training employment authorization, “Optical Practical Training (OPT),” for a period of one year after completing his or her degree program. 


	To enter the United States to attend vocational or recognized nonacademic institution, other than a language training program, an individual can seek an M visa. To obtain an M-1 visa for traveling to the United States, a student has to show a signed Form I-20 at a United States embassy or consulate in his or her home country. The I-20 Form is issued by the educational institution that the individual is enrolled in after the student has fulfilled a number of other requirements, including qualifying for admission at the school and presenting proof of financial resources. 


	The J visa is an Exchange Visitor non-immigrant visa category managed by the U.S. Department of State, along with many designated sponsors in each area. It is designed to foster mutual understanding between the people of the U.S. and individuals of other countries through educational and cultural exchanges. According to the U.S. State Department, each month you can find more than 170,000 participants in the United States, working, studying, or teaching through the J-1 program. The processing time for a J-category visa varies from country to country and is based on the individual’s specific situation. It is important to note that exchange visitors cannot enter the United States more than 30 days prior to the date their programs begin. 


	Obtaining a student visa is a multi-step process and can be quite a complicated process, so it is best to hire an effective immigration attorney in your area to ensure that your case runs smoothly.

New USCIS Policies for International Students & Companies,"Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has updated its policy guidance for F and M student visas, consolidating various rules into one clear document to reduce confusion and increase transparency for students and businesses. This includes clarifications on maintaining foreign residence while pursuing permanent residency, and new options for F-1 STEM students to work with startups during their Optional Practical Training (OPT) extensions.
The guidance addresses key areas such as employment authorization, change of status, extension of stay, and reinstatement of status for F and M students and their dependents in the United States.
The updated guidance emphasizes that F and M students must maintain a foreign residence and not intend to permanently abandon their home country.
Despite this, the policy now allows students to apply for permanent residency through green cards in the U.S. It’s crucial for students to demonstrate their intention to return to their home country after their temporary stay in the U.S., even as they explore long-term options.
For F-1 students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, the policy update is particularly noteworthy. It offers an extension of Optional Practical Training (OPT) for those seeking employment opportunities with startup companies.
The startups must comply with specific requirements: they need to adhere to the outlined training plans, be in good standing with E-Verify, and provide compensation that is on par with similarly situated U.S. workers. This creates new employment opportunities but also requires students and their employers to be vigilant about meeting these conditions.
USCIS has provided detailed explanations regarding the maintenance of student status. This includes comprehensive guidance on transferring schools, exploring different employment options while on a student visa, and the procedures for applying for various benefits.
The clearer guidelines help students understand their responsibilities and rights under their visa status. However, it also means that students need to be more proactive in ensuring their activities and employment align with these updated rules to maintain their legal status in the U.S.
While the policy update offers greater flexibility and opens up new avenues, it’s essential for students to plan their future in the U.S. with these regulations in mind.
Whether it’s considering long-term residency or seeking employment post-graduation, students should factor in these updated guidelines in their decision-making process.
IMPORTANT: With these changes, the onus is on the students to stay informed and compliant with the updated policies. This involves regularly checking for any new updates or changes in immigration policies that might affect their status.

“Understanding and adapting to the USCIS’s new policy guidance is crucial for employers seeking to tap into the rich pool of international talent. This guidance not only opens up new avenues for hiring bright minds, especially in the STEM fields, but also brings a responsibility to ensure compliance with the nuanced requirements,” said Hendrik Pretorius, Immigration Attorney and Director of Account Management at Boundless. “As companies navigate these changes, it’s important to strike a balance between leveraging global talent and adhering to the intricate landscape of immigration policies. Proactive engagement and informed strategies will be key to harnessing the potential of international students in a way that benefits both the students and the growth of our companies.”
USCIS’s revised policy guidance is a pivotal development for both F and M international students and U.S. employers. It aims to simplify and clarify the complexities of student visa categories, providing a clearer path for students pursuing education and career opportunities in the United States. For students, it opens doors to new opportunities, particularly in STEM fields, and delineates the conditions under which they can pursue permanent residency while on a student visa. Employers stand to benefit from a broader pool of international talent, especially in specialized STEM areas, with the added responsibility of ensuring compliance with the specific requirements of the OPT program. This guidance symbolizes a stride towards a more integrated and supportive framework for international students and the companies that seek to employ them, fostering an environment of growth, innovation, and mutual benefit. As we navigate these changes, the importance of staying informed, adhering to legal requirements, and seeking expert advice cannot be overstated, ensuring that the potential of these policies is fully realized for the enrichment of both international students and the American workforce.

F-1 Student Visa | San Jose Immigration Lawyer ...,"The F-1 visa is available to the foreign nationals who are coming to the U.S. as an international student. There are only certain schools in the United States, who are certified and authorized by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to accept international students. The current list of certified SEVP school list can be downloaded at Study in The States.
To qualify for student visa, foreign national must first obtain enrollment at SEVP certified school. Upon enrollment, the school will issue a Form I-20 to the applicant. Once the foreign national receives Form I-20, he/she is required to pay mandatory SEVP fees to the Immigration and Custom Enforcement. Please note that this fee must be paid before his/her visa interview at the U.S. Consulate or Embassy. Further, student visa is available to foreign national applicants who can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the U.S. Consulate that they have sufficient funds to pay the tuition fees and maintain themselves during the course of their study in the United States. Further, applicant will have to convince the consular officer that he/she will return to their country of origin at the expiration of the F-1 stay in the United States. If the consular officer will find any information/document missing, the student visa application will be put on hold until requisite information is submitted. In certain situations, this could very well result in foreign national not being able to join the school on time in the United States.
The F-1 visa holder’s spouse and unmarried children, who are under twenty-one (21) years of age are eligible for the F-2 dependent visa and may stay in the U.S as long as F-1 visa holder maintains his/her immigration status in the U.S. The spouse of the F-1 visa holder is not authorized to work in the U.S.
The validity of F-1 student status is valid for the duration of foreign nationals study in the United States.
F-1 student is eligible for temporary employment (optional practical training) in the United States that is related to his/her major area of study. He may be authorized to receive pre and post optional practical training (OPT). However the student must refrain from any unauthorized employment during the time period he/she maintains legal status in the U.S.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

"The F-1 Student Visa, Explained","Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
What is the F-1 visa?
The F-1 visa allows a student to temporarily live in the United States for a defined period of time while studying at a school, college, seminary, or conservatory.
Is the F-1 visa right for me?
For many students, the chance to study in the United States is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. Unless the person is already a U.S. citizen or green card holder, all prospective students will have to apply for a visa to study in the United States.
Because there are so many courses and places to study in the United States, the F-1 visa has a pretty broad application but also some very clear rules. The first is that you have to be coming to the United States with the intent to temporarily study. In other words, this is not an immigrant visa.
You must be studying at an academic institution, not training at a vocational school, as this will require an M-1 visa. Your academic institution must be approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning it needs to be accredited to be able to accept foreign students on F-1 visas.
You will be able to work, but because this is a non-immigrant visa, you will be restricted to where you can work and the type of work. Finally, although your spouse and children can come with you, they will not be able to work but your children can enroll in schools. They will be on F-2 visas and tied to your visa’s status.
Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have. Learn more about what we do to help.
The requirements for an F-1 visa are:
For many students, the process of applying and being accepted into a U.S. academic institution is the lengthiest part. The visa process is a series of steps that take place after you accept an enrollment offer. Not sure if you qualify for an F-1 student visa? Start by checking your eligibility.
Congratulations, you have been accepted into a course of study by a U.S. academic institution! Years of hard work probably led you to this milestone, so here’s the process to obtain your student visa.
After your SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be added to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVP uses SEVIS to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M, and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.
Once you have registered with SEVIS, you will need to pay the I-901 fee. This fee is currently $350 for most people, and funds the SEVP program.
Your SEVP-approved school will then issue you a Form I-20. This form is incredibly important as it confirms your acceptance at the school, and therefore your eligibility for the F-1 visa. Once this Form I-20 has been issued, you will be able to apply to a U.S. embassy or consulate for your F-1 visa.
The steps required will vary between different U.S. embassies or consulates, so make sure you check their websites for further information.
However, you must complete the Form DS-160, which is similar to the Form DS-260 for immigrant visas. The form is very detailed and can take some time to fill in, so make sure you set aside plenty of time to complete it.
Once you have completed the Form DS-160, you will need to schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, unless you are under 13 years of age or over 80 years of age. The U.S. Department of State says you should schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country where you live. You may schedule your interview at another U.S. embassy or consulate, but be aware that it may be more difficult to qualify for a visa outside of the country where you live.
Prior to your interview, you will need to pay the $185 application fee and also, depending on your nationality, pay an issuance fee, as well. The visa issuance fee is only due after your interview, if your visa is approved. The next step will be an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate.
Visa wait times can vary depending on the time of year and location. You can use the appointment wait time tool to see how long you will have to wait for an appointment at a specific U.S. embassy or consulate.
At this stage, it is important to note that F-1 visas for new students can only be issued up to 365 days (one year) in advance of the start date for a course of study. It used to be 120 days, but in February, 2023, the State Department extended the period.
Note: For existing F-1 visas, this is not the case and visas can be issued any time, as long as the student is currently enrolled at a SEVP-approved school or institution and in SEVIS.
Boundless not only makes it easy for you to complete your F-1 student visa application, but we can also help you get ready for your visa interview. Learn more about what you get with Boundless.
You will generally be required to attend an interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate. You will need to bring:
You should also be prepared to bring evidence of:
During your interview, the consular officer will ask you questions to determine whether or not to approve your F-1 visa. Make sure you are complete and accurate in your answers, as you will be under oath. For interview tips, see the Boundless guide on preparing for the F-1 student visa interview.
The consular officer will also take your fingerprints, although this will vary depending on your location. After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing. The consular officer will let you know if this is required.
Once your interview is complete, you will be informed of the outcome and, if successful, be issued a visa to study in the United States.

Yes, you can bring your spouse and children with you. Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
F-1 students cannot work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students can engage in three types of off-campus employment:
This depends on your individual taxation situation, but typically you might be required to file a U.S. tax return. For more information, seek advice from a qualified tax professional.
Generally, an F-1 student may transfer between SEVP-certified schools. However, this does involve paperwork and coordination. See here for more detailed instructions.
There are some programs and visas available for F-1 visa holders after you finish studying in the United States. These can be highly individual to your circumstances, field of study, and professional background, so do your research carefully.

"F-1 Visas for International Students: Requirements, Rules ...","Get ready to study abroad in America with our step-by-step guide to F-1 visa rules. 
Students wishing to study in the United States need to learn about the F-1 student visa application process. There are more than one million international students currently studying abroad in the USA, and with some preparation and guidance, you can join them. To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. The I-20 form provided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with your F-1 visa after graduation.
Have questions about the student visa process? Attend an upcoming Shorelight webinar > 
There are several F-1 visa rules to keep in mind if you plan to apply for a F-1 student visa. You must meet these requirements for your application to be accepted:
Institution certification—The college or the university where you plan to study needs to be approved by SEVP Immigration & Customs Enforcement.
Full-time enrollment—You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution while your academic term is in session.
English language proficiency—You must meet the required English language proficiency score of the institution you are attending or be enrolled in courses that will help you improve your English proficiency.
Sufficient funding—You must prove you have sufficient funds available to finance your studies and living expenses while in the US.
Valid passport—Your passport should be valid for US travel for at least six months after your program completion date.
Home country residency—You are required to have a residence in your home country to return to following the completion of your degree.

Before you begin your F-1 visa application, you must take the following steps:
Get accepted by a SEVP-certified institution before submitting your visa application. When you are accepted, you will receive your I-20 form, which you will need to apply for your F-1 visa.
Pay your SEVIS fee.
Complete your DS-160 visa application.
Schedule your visa interview.
Attend your visa interview.
If you are applying for a F-1 visa from India, Shorelight’s F-1 visa for Indian students guide is for you.
Once these steps are completed, you will be ready to complete and submit your F-1 student visa application. 
1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US government’s way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education. 
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay. 
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials. 
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., like getting a US driver’s license). 
Helpful resources: Confirm your US university is a SEVP-accredited institution 
Keep your Shorelight enrollment advisor updated through every step of the visa process – when you submit your application, schedule your visa interview, and, of course, when your visa application is approved.
2. Pay Your SEVIS Fee
The total cost for your F-1 student visa will be approximately $510, which includes the cost of the visa itself, plus SEVIS processing and maintenance fees. 
Requirements: Your I-20
Cost: $350 
Where to apply: Payment portal for your SEVIS fee
Make sure to save the I-901 SEVIS fee receipt. You will need it for your visa interview. 
3. Complete Your DS-160 Visa Application
Your DS-160 is your visa application. All prospective international students must complete a DS-160 to receive an F-1 visa. 
Requirements: Your I-20, passport, travel itinerary, photo for your visa
Cost: $160 
Where to apply: Application portal for your DS-160
After you successfully submit your DS-160, you will receive a printed confirmation with a barcode on it. Save this form – you will need it for your visa interview. 
4. Schedule Your Visa Interview
Find the nearest US embassy or consulate and schedule your visa interview. Wait times will vary by country and can take months — so remember to set up your appointments as early as possible!
If you are enrolling at a US university through Shorelight, ask your enrollment advisor about student visa interview tips or how to set up a mock interview session. Practicing your visa interview in advance will make you feel more comfortable with the process.
Ask your Shorelight advisor to set up a mock visa interview for you.
5. Attend Your Visa Interview
During the interview portion of the F-1 visa application process, the US consulate or embassy confirms you are coming to study as a legitimate, serious student. In your visa interview, you must also prove you have the funds to cover your time studying in the US, and confirm that you plan on returning home after your studies are complete. Attending your visa interview in person is required, though there are a few rare exceptions (e.g., if you are younger than 14 or older than 80 years of age, or if you meet certain visa renewal requirements). 
Cost: Your DS-160 payment covers the cost
Where to apply: Scheduling portal for your visa interview
After you successfully complete your visa interview, you will be granted your F-1 visa and acquire F-1 status. You are now cleared to study in the USA! 
Refer to Travel.state.gov to learn more. If you need any help with preparing or submitting your application, Shorelight provides application assistance for international students.
Before you attend your visa interview, make sure to have the following documents ready for evaluation by the consular officer:
A valid passport
A copy of the photo you will use for your visa
Printed copies of your DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmations
I-20 form
School transcript and official test scores cited on your university application
Diploma (if applicable)
Bank statements or other proof of finances
During your interview, the consular officer may request additional documents. To prepare, consider bringing the following documents:
Academic records such as transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates from schools you attended
Standardized test scores required by your US institution
Evidence of your intent to depart the United States upon completion of your course of study
Statements proving your ability to pay all educational, living, and travel costs
As an international student, you might feel uncertain about your upcoming interview. While feeling nervous is normal, do not forget to take a deep breath and remember that you are well prepared! Your interview is important, but should not be stressful.
Your interviewer will ask questions to determine: 
Are you a legitimate student?
Do you have the resources to pay for your studies?
Do you plan to return home after completing your degree?
To prepare for your F-1 student visa interview, here are some questions you might be asked: 
Why did you pick this university?
Which other US universities did you apply to?
How will you pay for your education?
Do you have relatives in the USA?
Do you plan to work while in the USA?
What do you plan to do after graduation?
Your Shorelight advisor can help you prepare for your interview by giving you a detailed overview of what the process will involve. They can also help you practice with mock interviews! Shorelight’s F-1 student visa interview guide can also help you learn more about what you can do to prepare for your upcoming interview. 
There is a possibility that your F-1 visa application will be denied. If this happens, you will be given detailed reasoning in writing, including the section of the law that led to the denial of your application.  
To avoid having your F-1 student visa application denied, it is important to read and follow all instructions carefully. Always double- and triple-check your documents before submitting your application. Shorelight advisors can offer visa assistance to make this process easier for you: They are happy to help you organize all the documents you will need, in the correct formats, and on schedule. 
Remember: During your F-1 student visa interview, you want to sufficiently demonstrate that you are traveling to the US to study and planning to return to your home country once your program is complete. Keep this in mind as you answer your interview questions.
As an international student, you must actively maintain your F-1 status to continue studying in the US. To do this, you must comply with both university regulations and codes of conduct, as well as with the requirements and conditions set out in your F-1 visa requirements. 
When entering the US:
Make sure to enter the US no more than 30 days before your program begins.
As soon as you arrive in the country, contact your designated school official (DSO).
When you arrive at your university, contact your DSO again before the start date listed on your I-20 form.
While studying in the US:
Attend all your classes and maintain good academic standing. If you require support with any of your classes, your Shorelight advisor can direct you to academic resources to help you improve.
If you need extra time to complete your program which would exceed the end date specified in your I-20, speak with your DSO to discuss your options for possible extensions.
Make sure to enroll for a full course of study when your academic term is in session.
If you want to drop a class or change classes, make sure to speak to your DSO first.
If you want to take a break and/or go on vacation, remember to first complete at least one full academic year at your institution.  After your holiday, you must also register for classes in the next academic term.
Yes, you will be able to work in the US on a F-1 student visa. However, you will have to follow certain F-1 visa rules and restrictions:
You can only work part time on campus while your academic term is in session
You can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week
You may be able to work off campus with the approval of your university
During academic breaks, you will be permitted to work full time, if your university allows it. You can learn more about working as a F-1 international student by referring to USCIS.gov.
When searching for work while you study, make sure to seek approval from your DSO first. 
Keep in mind, once you finish your program, you will have a grace period of 60 days to leave the US. If you wish to extend your stay, you can speak to a Shorelight advisor to explore your options, such as transferring to another school or pursuing further education. You can also refer to Shorelight’s F-1 extension guide to have a look at your options.
Now that you know how US non-immigrant visas work for international students, create a checklist of next steps and get started. The sooner you begin fulfilling the USA study visa requirements, the better chance you will have of securing your spot at an American university.

F1 Visa - US Student Visa Requirements and Application ...,"In this article
In this article
US student visa requirements, eligibility criteria, the application steps and FAQs
In this article
The F1 visa is a student visa that is given to international students who want to attend educational institutions in the United States. It covers levels from elementary school to university and graduate school, including other degrees.
To qualify to even apply for an F1 visa you must meet some specific conditions, such as:
Here are the documents required to apply for an F1 Visa:
To application process for the F1 visa goes through the following steps:
After you apply and are accepted into the school you want to attend, they will have to complete some procedures so that you can apply for the F1 visa. The most important document you need to have is Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status. Without this form, you will not be able to apply for an F1 student visa and attend your interview.
After you get your Form I-20, you can start the usual application process. This includes filing the DS-160 form online with the necessary information about your visa status.
The application fee for the student visa is $185. You must pay this fee and get the receipt, which you will need later for your interview documents. You might have to pay additional fees based on your country of origin and the US Embassy you are applying from.
When you are admitted by the SEVP institution, your school immediately registers you in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). To have full registration, there is a SEVIS I-901 fee. For the F1 visa, this fee is $200.
After filing the DS-160 form and paying the fees, you will need to schedule your interview. The interview is a mandatory step before you get your student visa. Try to schedule it as early as possible, since there might be delays due to the heavy workload of the US Embassy. When you schedule it, you will receive an interview appointment letter which you will need later on in the application process.
Before you go to attend your interview, you should prepare your file with the required documents for students.
When you go to attend the student visa interview, the questions will mostly revolve around your reasons for going to the US and the institution you are going to. The interviewer will try to assess whether you intend to return to your home country after you complete your degree.
When your visa is approved, it might be for the full time that you will be in school in the US, or for less. If your study program takes 1 year to graduate, the Embassy will most likely give you a visa that is valid for 1 year If your degree program is 2 years and you only get the visa for 1 year, you should then later apply to renew it. In this case, it is the best option to renew the F1 visa.
The validity of your F1 visa is for as long as it is stated on your I-20 form and I-94 form which is given to you when you enter the US.
If you are renewing your visa you should follow the same procedure. You might be able to waive the interview on the reason that you have already done it once and your intent is to continue your education for the remaining years to get your degree.
If your visa is approved, you are allowed to depart for the US 30 days before your program begins. You cannot enter the US any earlier than that.
In most cases, you will get the response on this visa immediately after the interview. At the end of the visa interview, the interviewer might congratulate you for getting the visa or will provide you with a document letting you know the reason for denial. This is because the processing of this type of visa actually happens before your interview. The interview is the last step for the US Embassy to assess whether they should issue the visa.
There are, however, cases where the response and processing of the F1 visa takes a few days, so you should be patient if that happens.
After you are admitted into the institution of your choice, you can apply for the visa 120 days before you are scheduled to start your program. You cannot apply any earlier, but applying later might cause you a delay due to processing times. So as soon as the 120-day countdown begins, make sure you submit your application.
After your visa expires, you have a 60 day grace period to prepare for your departure to your home country. If your visa doesn’t cover the whole time that you will be in school in the US, you will have to apply for renewal or extensions. The extensions are approved only if you can prove you will be completing your degree in the US and you intend to return as soon as it is over.
You may work as an F1 student but only for short periods of time since your visa is a student and not a work visa. You are allowed to work part-time on campus while school is in session and full time during breaks. If you want to work outside of campus, you have two options.
If you, for example, find a job that requires a different type of visa, other than F1, then you are also eligible to change status. You just need to work through the instructions of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and your employer or another petitioner.
Even though you have proved that you have strong ties to your home country, if you want to apply for a Green Card, you are allowed to do so on an F1 visa. It is a complicated procedure, though. You must either self-petition as a person with extraordinary abilities, get married in the US or prove that you will invest $500,000 in the US economy.
If these are not feasible for you, but you still want to remain in the US, the easiest way is to change status into a different type of visa such as an H-1B visa and have your employer sponsor you.
F1 visa students quite often have to travel abroad. They travel during university breaks or in case of emergencies. The travel can be to their own home countries or to other countries.
If you are an F1 visa student who wants to travel abroad, before you plan and book their travel you must follow some instructions. The instructions are to ensure that they can enter the United States again.
In case you have dependents, such as a spouse or unmarried children under 21 years old, they are allowed to come to the US too. This can be done with an F2 visa.
The F2 visa has no cap and dependents should just fulfill the requirements and complete the application procedures to get the visa. To be eligible for an F-2 visa, you must fulfill the following criteria:

Student visa for the USA - The American Dream,"
Studying in the United States is a perfect career stepping stone. Therefore, the USA is one of the most popular study countries globally. Learn which visa categories are available for students in America and get important tips on how to apply.
Take the chance of living in the USA and apply for the official US Green Card Lottery!
For studies in the United States leading to a university degree, you will need a student visa. Visas for students belong to the category of non-immigrant visas and are subject to certain conditions.
Furthermore, internships and comparable programs are also considered in the student visa categories:
American schools and universities must have a SEVP certificate in order for you to enroll as a foreign student. Thus, you can only get an F-1 or M-1 visa for certified schools. This does not apply to J-1 exchange programs.
Short leisure study programs of up to 18 hours per week that do not count toward your university degree can be completed visa-free with an ESTA or B-visa.
Studying at a US university opens many career doors.
Suppose you are thinking about studying abroad in the USA. In that case, it is best to refer to the current educational institutions listed with the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS regularly provides an up-to-date PDF of certified schools and universities and an overview of the application process.
If you do not have a Green Card, the most important requirement for studying in the USA is being able to reimburse publicly subsidized costs from universities or educational institutions.
To apply for an F-1, J-1, or M-1 visa, you must also present the following proof or documents:
If you want to avoid high tuition fees in the USA, participate in the Green Card Lottery. Having a Green Card exempts you from the extra high fees foreigners pay for studying in the USA.
Most study programs offered by colleges, universities, conservatories, high schools, or language schools in the United States require you to apply for an F-1 visa.
In the case of language courses, this also depends on the intensity of the study: if a course is over 18 hours per week, an F-1 visa is required. With an F-1 visa, you may:
In exceptional cases, you may apply for a work permit to earn money during your studies in the USA.
F-1 visas are usually issued for five years. However, your residence permit is firmly linked to the duration of your studies or language course, which is noted in the I-20 form. If your studies end, so does your residence permit.
If delays such as illness or a change of subject mean that you will not be able to complete your studies in the specified period, you may be eligible to apply for an extension of your F-1 visa.
The cost of an F-1 visa to study in the USA consists of consular fees and the so-called SEVIS fee.
The J-1 category covers exchange programs administered by the U.S. Department of State. The purpose of the J-1 visa is to promote educational and cultural exchanges between the United States and other nations. There is no requirement to be a student to apply for a J-1 visa. Instead, with a J-1 visa, you may:
Depending on the program, the J-1 visa is valid for an average of between 12 and 24 months. Your residence permit is linked to the duration of your internship, employment, or exchange.
If delays mean that you will not be able to complete your internship, school year, or job in the specified time period, you may apply for an extension of your J-1 visa.
The cost of a J-1 visa for internships, au pair jobs, high school years, summer jobs, or traineeships includes consular fees and the SEVIS fee, which varies in amount depending on the purpose:
The M-1 visa allows you to receive education or training at a non-academic educational institution or facility such as a flight school, cosmetology school, or culinary school.
With an M-1 visa, you may:
Language schools are excluded from the M-1 category (you would need an F-1 visa for this).
Professional training is covered by US student visa categories.
The M-1 visa is valid for a maximum of 12 months or until the end of your education or training.
Suppose delays beyond your control prevent you from completing your education or training in the United States within the specified time. In that case, you may be eligible to apply for an extension of your M-1 visa.
The cost of an M-1 visa to train in the USA includes consular fees and the SEVIS fee.
SEVIS stands for ""Student and Exchange Visitor Information System"" and refers to a database that allows the US government to keep track of all student visas issued.
Before you can apply for a student visa, you must pay this fee - otherwise, you will not get a visa.
Depending on whether you choose a US government-sponsored exchange program (J-1) or privately organized studies (F-1 or M-1), the application process will slightly differ:
In the visa interview at your local US embassy or consulate, you must confirm and prove the information you provided in the ""Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application"" (Form DS-160).
Therefore, you will need to present all original documents you received during the visa process or essential to prove the information you provided. These include:
The embassy or consulate staff member will inform you whether your visa is approved at the end of your interview. Once approved, you can start making arrangements to move to the USA.
The path to studying or an internship in the USA always involves the DS-160 application form.
The wait times for visa interview appointments vary depending on your place of residence and visa category. Check up-to-date times at your local embassy or consulate on the U.S. Department of State's visa appointment wait times page.
A new student visa will be issued no more than 120 days before the start date of a degree program. If you are already in the middle of your studies and need to apply for a visa extension, you may do so at any time as long as you are properly listed as a United States student visa holder in SEVIS.
It is recommended that you submit your visa application as soon as you receive your I-20 or DS-2019 form, respectively, from your educational institution or sponsor.
With a new student visa, you may enter the United States no earlier than 30 days before your studies begin. Remember to carry your original I-20 or DS-209 form in addition to the usual entry documents.
If the purpose of your student visa (i.e., your studies, internship, advanced training, or summer job) ends, you must be out of the country within 60 days.
Under certain conditions, you can make a so-called ""change of status"" if the reason for your stay in the USA changes spontaneously. This allows you to change from a normal visitor to an officially recognized US student.
To change your residency status, you must:
Before applying for a change of status, check with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for the documentation required in your personal case.
Applying for a Green Card is possible as an F-1, M-1, or J-1 student visa holder under certain conditions. Potential ""entry routes"" to become a Permanent Resident (Green Card holder) are:
Of all the ways to go from studying abroad in the United States to becoming a legal resident with Permanent Residency and a work permit, entering the Green Card Lottery is the easiest. The odds of you becoming one of the 55,000 annual Green Card winners are excellent.
If you are entering the United States on an F-1, M-1, or J-1 visa, your spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 may join you using F-2, M-2, or J-2 and remain in the United States for the duration of your studies.
To make this possible, you must register your family members with SEVIS as well (SEVIS Dependent Form), complete the DS-160 form for each individual, and provide proof of your relationship.
Incomplete documents, inadequate financial resources, or errors in forms can lead to the rejection of your United States student visa. Also, sometimes the personal impression of the consulate staff or a so-called ""background check"" plays a role.
If you know the reasons for your rejection, you can reapply (you are allowed to apply three times within one year).
However, if you are unsure of the exact reasons, seek advice from your local US consulate or the team of experts at The American Dream's US Visa Service.

Guidelines and Requirements of Student Visas Worldwide,"In this article

Complete guide to the worldwide student visas, the general requirements, the standard application process, and FAQs
In this article
With over a billion international students across the globe, student visas are now more in demand than ever. The idea of spending a semester or completing a study program abroad is highly appealing to young students everywhere. But, everyone who plans on becoming an international student must learn how to apply for a student visa.
A student visa is a document that allows you to pursue a study program in a foreign country. Student visas are usually issued for short-term purposes, and you must have already been accepted to a university or educational institution to qualify for the visa.
To make sure your student visa does not get canceled, you have to follow the student visa rules:
These are the student visas for some of the most popular student destinations:
See other countries that offer student visas below:
The application process for a student visa goes as follows:
To be eligible for a student visa, you must be enrolled in a valid study program in a foreign country. So before you can apply for the visa, you have to submit your application for the study program of your choice.
Once you’ve been accepted to a study program, you have to find a local embassy or consulate in your country and make an appointment for your visa interview. Please note that an embassy and a consulate are different units, and in cases where both are absent in your home country, you may be required to submit your application to a neighboring country’s visa office.
To submit your application, you must prepare the required documents. Make sure you make photocopies of any required documents, have them certified with an apostille stamp, and take your passport pictures. Also, check with the visa office to see which documents may require translation so you can get them ready.
You have to pay the visa application fee in time. Some visa offices may ask you to do that before you attend your visa appointment, while others may ask you to do it on the same day— make sure you double-check with the proper authorities.
Finally, all you have to do is attend the visa interview as scheduled. Make sure you don’t miss the date or the time, as it might be challenging for you to reschedule before your semester starts.
You will need the following documents for your student visa application:
A student visa lasts for the duration of your educational program. So, if you will be studying for two years in a foreign country, your visa will be issued for the same amount of time. Most study visas are issued anywhere between two to four years.
It takes several months to finish processing your student visa application. Some countries may finish faster than others, depending on how complete your application is and how many people have applied for student visas.
Student visa prices range anywhere between $160 and $600, including your service and administrative fees. The fee for a student visa changes based on which country you will study in; some countries may waive the visa fee for students altogether— you have to contact the embassy or consulate to find out the required fee.
Some countries may allow you to extend your student visa if you are behind on your study program. However, the visa extension policy is different in every country, so you need to check with the embassy and your education provider.
Yes, but you can usually only bring your partner/spouse and minor children. Please remember that your family members will also need to apply for their visas.
Your student visa can be denied for the following reasons:
You have to re-apply for your student visa. Before you submit another application, make sure you identify the reasons for your initial denial and address them. However, you should also keep in mind that you might miss the deadline to enter the country for your study program if your student visa is rejected.
In this case, there is a possibility that you might lose your spot in the program. At this point, you have to contact the admissions office and let them know that you are having issues with your student visa and see if they can give you an extension.

F1 Student Visa - The Application Process and Interview Tips,"Register Now!






	An F1 visa is issued to international students who are attending an academic program or English Language Program at a US college or university. F1 students must maintain the minimum course load for full-time student status. They can remain in the US up to 60 days beyond the length of time it takes to complete their academic program, unless they have applied and been approved to stay and work for a period of time under the OPT Program.


	F1 students are expected to complete their studies by the expiration date on their I-20 form (Certificate of Eligibility for Non-immigrant Student Status) which is provided by the US college or university that the student has been accepted to and will attend.


		In order to qualify, applicants need to satisfy and prove several strict criteria during an F1 visa interview, including the following:
	

			Different universities have different admission policies. Your university will tell you what they need to determine if you are academically eligible. Among other requirements, you will need to show the school that you have enough money to support yourself while studying without having to work and you may have to show health insurance in order to cover any medical expenses should you need any medical assistance. Once the university has determined that your application is complete and you are academically eligible, they will issue an I-20 form to enable you to apply for your student visa.
		

			Applicants for student visas should generally apply at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate with jurisdiction over their place of permanent residence. This will normally be your home country — the country in which you live. Although visa applicants may apply at any U.S. consular office abroad, it may be more difficult to qualify for the visa outside the country of permanent residence.
		

Find a U.S. Embassy or Consulate


			The process of obtaining a visa can be difficult. If you’ve decided you need help from an immigration lawyer, explore working with a professional legal firm like F1 Visa Advisors, Inc. Founded by an experienced immigration lawyer in the US, F1 Visa Advisors offers a limited access program that provides students with personalized visa assistance and guidance to help increase their chance of getting approved an F1 visa.
		

	Always protect yourself by keeping a copy of everything that you fill out and send off.


		Although the process may vary or require additional steps, depending on your country and embassy or consulate, you will need the following when applying for your student visa:
	

Learn more about how to apply for your F1 Student Visa 

An F1 visa interview will be required to determine whether or not you are qualified to receive an F1 student visa. You should arrive at the interview with all of the required documents and receipts, and you should be prepared ahead of time to answer personal questions about your decision to study in the US. There are a number of common F1 Visa interview questions which we will look at below.


	If you've been denied your visa and would like to learn more about how to increase your chance of getting F1 visa approval, explore F1 Visa Advisors, Inc.

	If approved, you may be required to pay a visa issuance fee. Digital fingerprint scans will be taken for records. Your passport will be taken so that you can get your visa and you will be informed when you can get it back, either by pick-up or in the mail.


	Keep in mind that visa issuance is not guaranteed. Never make final travel plans until you have your visa approved. If your visa is denied, you will be given a reason based on the section of law which applies to your ineligibility. Filing a waiver of ineligibility is possible in some cases.


See more sample F1 Visa Interview Questions 

	If your F1 visa application is denied, it is based on US immigration law. If you are denied, the reason and section of law you are denied under will be given to you in your paperwork. Some applications are denied because the applicant failed to provide necessary information or supporting documentation as required. Sometimes, however, you can be found ineligible for other reasons.


	Of course, if you do not meet the F1 Visa Qualifications as stated above, you can expect to be found ineligible. For example, if you do not sufficiently demonstrate that the strong ties to your home country will influence you to return home after your stay in the US, you will be denied under INA section 214(b), Visa Qualifications and Immigrant Intent.


	Other common reasons for denial include Fraud or Misrepresentation, Unlawful Presence in the United States, Health-related grounds, Criminal-related grounds, or Security-related grounds. To learn more about visa denials and to see if you are eligible for a waiver or to reapply, the US Department of State website is a great resource.


	Denied your visa? If you need more information on the F1 visa process and tips on passing the F1 visa interview, see
	how F1 Visa Advisors, Inc can help. Learn more about F1 Visa Advisors, Inc.

	After you are approved for your F1 visa, you are able to enter the United States as an international student. However, after you arrive, you will need to stay aware of your obligations as an F1 visa holder. If you do not maintain your valid F1 visa status, you will not be allowed to return to re-enter the US if you leave and you will not be eligible for practical training (OPT or CPT) or on-campus employment. Here are some tips to assure you’re in good standing during your study abroad:


	Make sure you arrive in the US no more than 30 days prior to the first day of classes. Check in with your international advisor as soon as possible before your program begins.


	You must remain enrolled full time. Go to class and maintain passing grades. If you are having difficulty in your classes, notify your international advisor. If you are unable to complete your program by the date listed on your Form I-20, your international advisor can help you request a program extension.


	Your passport should be valid for at least 6-months in the future. Your country’s consulate or embassy can help you extend your passport if needed. Carry a copy of your passport with you along with your I-94 card for identification purposes.

Always notify your international advisor or office if you make changes to your address, study plans, or visa status.

	F1 visa students are not allowed to work off-campus. However, you may have some on-campus work or curricular practical training options if you qualify. Check with your international advisor to see if this is a possibility for you. If you choose to work without proper authorization, your visa will be revoked and you will be forced to leave the United States.


	You have 60 days upon completion of your program to leave the United States under your F1 visa. To remain in the US, you will need to re-enroll in a higher program, transfer to another school to receive a new I-20 form, or apply to change your visa status. Your international advisor can give you more information regarding your options.

Generally, a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.

If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website. 
If you are interested in changing to F or M Student Status, see the Changing to a Nonimmigrant F or M Student Status page.

"F-1 Visas for International Students: Requirements, Rules ...","Get ready to study abroad in America with our step-by-step guide to F-1 visa rules. 
Students wishing to study in the United States need to learn about the F-1 student visa application process. There are more than one million international students currently studying abroad in the USA, and with some preparation and guidance, you can join them. To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. The I-20 form provided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with your F-1 visa after graduation.
Have questions about the student visa process? Attend an upcoming Shorelight webinar > 
There are several F-1 visa rules to keep in mind if you plan to apply for a F-1 student visa. You must meet these requirements for your application to be accepted:
Institution certification—The college or the university where you plan to study needs to be approved by SEVP Immigration & Customs Enforcement.
Full-time enrollment—You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution while your academic term is in session.
English language proficiency—You must meet the required English language proficiency score of the institution you are attending or be enrolled in courses that will help you improve your English proficiency.
Sufficient funding—You must prove you have sufficient funds available to finance your studies and living expenses while in the US.
Valid passport—Your passport should be valid for US travel for at least six months after your program completion date.
Home country residency—You are required to have a residence in your home country to return to following the completion of your degree.

Before you begin your F-1 visa application, you must take the following steps:
Get accepted by a SEVP-certified institution before submitting your visa application. When you are accepted, you will receive your I-20 form, which you will need to apply for your F-1 visa.
Pay your SEVIS fee.
Complete your DS-160 visa application.
Schedule your visa interview.
Attend your visa interview.
If you are applying for a F-1 visa from India, Shorelight’s F-1 visa for Indian students guide is for you.
Once these steps are completed, you will be ready to complete and submit your F-1 student visa application. 
1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US government’s way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education. 
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay. 
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials. 
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., like getting a US driver’s license). 
Helpful resources: Confirm your US university is a SEVP-accredited institution 
Keep your Shorelight enrollment advisor updated through every step of the visa process – when you submit your application, schedule your visa interview, and, of course, when your visa application is approved.
2. Pay Your SEVIS Fee
The total cost for your F-1 student visa will be approximately $510, which includes the cost of the visa itself, plus SEVIS processing and maintenance fees. 
Requirements: Your I-20
Cost: $350 
Where to apply: Payment portal for your SEVIS fee
Make sure to save the I-901 SEVIS fee receipt. You will need it for your visa interview. 
3. Complete Your DS-160 Visa Application
Your DS-160 is your visa application. All prospective international students must complete a DS-160 to receive an F-1 visa. 
Requirements: Your I-20, passport, travel itinerary, photo for your visa
Cost: $160 
Where to apply: Application portal for your DS-160
After you successfully submit your DS-160, you will receive a printed confirmation with a barcode on it. Save this form – you will need it for your visa interview. 
4. Schedule Your Visa Interview
Find the nearest US embassy or consulate and schedule your visa interview. Wait times will vary by country and can take months — so remember to set up your appointments as early as possible!
If you are enrolling at a US university through Shorelight, ask your enrollment advisor about student visa interview tips or how to set up a mock interview session. Practicing your visa interview in advance will make you feel more comfortable with the process.
Ask your Shorelight advisor to set up a mock visa interview for you.
5. Attend Your Visa Interview
During the interview portion of the F-1 visa application process, the US consulate or embassy confirms you are coming to study as a legitimate, serious student. In your visa interview, you must also prove you have the funds to cover your time studying in the US, and confirm that you plan on returning home after your studies are complete. Attending your visa interview in person is required, though there are a few rare exceptions (e.g., if you are younger than 14 or older than 80 years of age, or if you meet certain visa renewal requirements). 
Cost: Your DS-160 payment covers the cost
Where to apply: Scheduling portal for your visa interview
After you successfully complete your visa interview, you will be granted your F-1 visa and acquire F-1 status. You are now cleared to study in the USA! 
Refer to Travel.state.gov to learn more. If you need any help with preparing or submitting your application, Shorelight provides application assistance for international students.
Before you attend your visa interview, make sure to have the following documents ready for evaluation by the consular officer:
A valid passport
A copy of the photo you will use for your visa
Printed copies of your DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmations
I-20 form
School transcript and official test scores cited on your university application
Diploma (if applicable)
Bank statements or other proof of finances
During your interview, the consular officer may request additional documents. To prepare, consider bringing the following documents:
Academic records such as transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates from schools you attended
Standardized test scores required by your US institution
Evidence of your intent to depart the United States upon completion of your course of study
Statements proving your ability to pay all educational, living, and travel costs
As an international student, you might feel uncertain about your upcoming interview. While feeling nervous is normal, do not forget to take a deep breath and remember that you are well prepared! Your interview is important, but should not be stressful.
Your interviewer will ask questions to determine: 
Are you a legitimate student?
Do you have the resources to pay for your studies?
Do you plan to return home after completing your degree?
To prepare for your F-1 student visa interview, here are some questions you might be asked: 
Why did you pick this university?
Which other US universities did you apply to?
How will you pay for your education?
Do you have relatives in the USA?
Do you plan to work while in the USA?
What do you plan to do after graduation?
Your Shorelight advisor can help you prepare for your interview by giving you a detailed overview of what the process will involve. They can also help you practice with mock interviews! Shorelight’s F-1 student visa interview guide can also help you learn more about what you can do to prepare for your upcoming interview. 
There is a possibility that your F-1 visa application will be denied. If this happens, you will be given detailed reasoning in writing, including the section of the law that led to the denial of your application.  
To avoid having your F-1 student visa application denied, it is important to read and follow all instructions carefully. Always double- and triple-check your documents before submitting your application. Shorelight advisors can offer visa assistance to make this process easier for you: They are happy to help you organize all the documents you will need, in the correct formats, and on schedule. 
Remember: During your F-1 student visa interview, you want to sufficiently demonstrate that you are traveling to the US to study and planning to return to your home country once your program is complete. Keep this in mind as you answer your interview questions.
As an international student, you must actively maintain your F-1 status to continue studying in the US. To do this, you must comply with both university regulations and codes of conduct, as well as with the requirements and conditions set out in your F-1 visa requirements. 
When entering the US:
Make sure to enter the US no more than 30 days before your program begins.
As soon as you arrive in the country, contact your designated school official (DSO).
When you arrive at your university, contact your DSO again before the start date listed on your I-20 form.
While studying in the US:
Attend all your classes and maintain good academic standing. If you require support with any of your classes, your Shorelight advisor can direct you to academic resources to help you improve.
If you need extra time to complete your program which would exceed the end date specified in your I-20, speak with your DSO to discuss your options for possible extensions.
Make sure to enroll for a full course of study when your academic term is in session.
If you want to drop a class or change classes, make sure to speak to your DSO first.
If you want to take a break and/or go on vacation, remember to first complete at least one full academic year at your institution.  After your holiday, you must also register for classes in the next academic term.
Yes, you will be able to work in the US on a F-1 student visa. However, you will have to follow certain F-1 visa rules and restrictions:
You can only work part time on campus while your academic term is in session
You can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week
You may be able to work off campus with the approval of your university
During academic breaks, you will be permitted to work full time, if your university allows it. You can learn more about working as a F-1 international student by referring to USCIS.gov.
When searching for work while you study, make sure to seek approval from your DSO first. 
Keep in mind, once you finish your program, you will have a grace period of 60 days to leave the US. If you wish to extend your stay, you can speak to a Shorelight advisor to explore your options, such as transferring to another school or pursuing further education. You can also refer to Shorelight’s F-1 extension guide to have a look at your options.
Now that you know how US non-immigrant visas work for international students, create a checklist of next steps and get started. The sooner you begin fulfilling the USA study visa requirements, the better chance you will have of securing your spot at an American university.

Apply For Your U.S. Student Visa: Undergraduate,"
Jump to navigation

The United States government offers three student visa types including F, J, and M.
Before you can apply for an F, J, or M student visa, you must first apply and be accepted by a U.S. institution of higher education that is certified by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP).
Even when an institution is SEVP-certified and able to issue I-20 and DS-2019 forms for use in visa applications, it may not hold national or regional accreditation. The U.S. Department of Education and Council for Higher Education Accreditation databases list accreditation status for all U.S. institutions. Institutions designated by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to place participants in Academic Exchange programs (J visas) must be accredited. Recognition of course credits and degrees by other institutions and by U.S. and international employers is linked to an institution's accreditation. To learn more about accreditation talk to an EducationUSA Adviser in person or online.
Once accepted at an SEVP-certified school, you will receive a Form I-20 or DS-2019 from the institution's international student office to present when you apply for your student visa. Once you receive your form, visit:
1. U.S. Department of State - Consular Affairs (Student Visas)
2. U.S. Department of State - U.S. Embassies and Consulates
3. U.S. Department of Homeland Security - Study in the States
It is important to note that two separate U.S. government agencies are involved with international student arrival and status while studying in the United States. The State Department is responsible for the visa application process and issuing the visa. Once a visa holder arrives in the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then takes over as the responsible agency for entry into the country, as well as issuing and enforcing international student regulations. Please read information from all three sources above before applying for a U.S. student visa. The sites address employment, maintaining your status, and other vital topics.

On April 2, 2024, the U.S.
While studying in the United States, it is important to maintain your F or M student status. Your status relates to the purpose, or reason for why you want to come to the United States. The U.S. Department of State issues you your visa based on your intended purpose. 
If the Department of State issues you an F or M student visa, this means that you are coming to the United States to study. You should not take any action that detracts from that purpose. Maintaining your status means:
Fulfilling the purpose for why the Department of State issued you your visa.
Following the regulations associated with that purpose.
F-1 and M-1 students share the same primary purpose for coming to the United States however, F-1 students enroll in more traditional academic programs, while M-1 students enroll in vocational programs. Because these two types of programs are different in nature, the types of benefits an international student may be eligible for and how long they may remain in the country depend on whether they are an F-1 or M-1 student.  Learn more about these specific differences by reviewing the F&M Student Status: Know the Difference infographic.
Below are actions to take in order to properly maintain your status.
When arriving to the United States, both F and M students must:
Enter the United States no more than 30 days before your program of study begins.
Immediately contact your designated school official (DSO) when you enter the United States.
When you arrive at school, you need to contact your DSO again, no later than the program start date listed on your Form I-20, ""Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.""
While studying in the United States, both F and M students must:
F-1 students must complete at least one full academic year at an SEVP-certified school to be eligible for annual vacation. Additionally, students must intend to register for classes in the academic term following their annual vacation.
SEVP-certified schools should have clear and consistent policies regarding annual vacation and comply with the requirements laid out in SEVP Policy Guidance for Adjudicators 1408-01: Academic Year.
Please note that during an annual vacation, students can take as many, as few or no courses as they want. SEVP considers all study during an annual vacation incident to status.
An F student may only work when authorized by a DSO in some cases, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in others. If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately, and you may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date. 
F students are also eligible for optional practical training during or following the program of study. OPT is a form of temporary employment that directly relates to your program of study. 
For more information about employment and training options available for F-students, visit the Working in the United States page and talk with your DSO.
M-1 students are not eligible for employment during their program of study, but may obtain authorization for practical training employment. You may participate in practical training employment after the completion of your vocational program. 
If you want to participate in practical training employment in the United States, talk with your DSO about your options. Practical training employment requires your DSO’s recommendation and authorization from USCIS. 
If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately. You may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date.
F and M students must take action to maintain legal status or depart the United States after completing your program of study.
Once you complete your program of study and any authorized period of practical training, F students have 60 days after completion of your program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. If you wish to extend your stay in the United States, talk with your DSO to learn more about doing one of the following:
Transfer to another school.
Change your education level (e.g. bachelor’s to master’s).
Apply to change status  to another visa status (e.g. H-1B-temporary worker; O-extraordinary ability in science, art or business; P-athlete).
M students have 30 days after completion of their program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. The latest date you may remain in the United States is the “admit until” date on your Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record,” unless you filed for an extension with USCIS.
If you are an F or M student studying in the United States, your DSO should be the first person you talk with if you have any questions regarding the legal requirements of your stay in the United States. Your DSO can assist in answering your questions or help you find someone who can help.
M-1 students should speak with their DSO if they are planning to do any of the following:
Take a break from school.
Travel outside the United States.
Move to a new address.
Request a program extension.
Both F and M students may contact SEVP by email at sevp@ice.dhs.gov if your DSO is unable to assist you or if you would prefer to ask someone else.
In your email, please describe your situation and include any questions you have. SEVP provides responses on a first-come, first-served basis. Answer times may vary depending on the current number of inquiries.

"The F-1 Student Visa, Explained","Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
What is the F-1 visa?
The F-1 visa allows a student to temporarily live in the United States for a defined period of time while studying at a school, college, seminary, or conservatory.
Is the F-1 visa right for me?
For many students, the chance to study in the United States is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. Unless the person is already a U.S. citizen or green card holder, all prospective students will have to apply for a visa to study in the United States.
Because there are so many courses and places to study in the United States, the F-1 visa has a pretty broad application but also some very clear rules. The first is that you have to be coming to the United States with the intent to temporarily study. In other words, this is not an immigrant visa.
You must be studying at an academic institution, not training at a vocational school, as this will require an M-1 visa. Your academic institution must be approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning it needs to be accredited to be able to accept foreign students on F-1 visas.
You will be able to work, but because this is a non-immigrant visa, you will be restricted to where you can work and the type of work. Finally, although your spouse and children can come with you, they will not be able to work but your children can enroll in schools. They will be on F-2 visas and tied to your visa’s status.
Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have. Learn more about what we do to help.
The requirements for an F-1 visa are:
For many students, the process of applying and being accepted into a U.S. academic institution is the lengthiest part. The visa process is a series of steps that take place after you accept an enrollment offer. Not sure if you qualify for an F-1 student visa? Start by checking your eligibility.
Congratulations, you have been accepted into a course of study by a U.S. academic institution! Years of hard work probably led you to this milestone, so here’s the process to obtain your student visa.
After your SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be added to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVP uses SEVIS to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M, and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.
Once you have registered with SEVIS, you will need to pay the I-901 fee. This fee is currently $350 for most people, and funds the SEVP program.
Your SEVP-approved school will then issue you a Form I-20. This form is incredibly important as it confirms your acceptance at the school, and therefore your eligibility for the F-1 visa. Once this Form I-20 has been issued, you will be able to apply to a U.S. embassy or consulate for your F-1 visa.
The steps required will vary between different U.S. embassies or consulates, so make sure you check their websites for further information.
However, you must complete the Form DS-160, which is similar to the Form DS-260 for immigrant visas. The form is very detailed and can take some time to fill in, so make sure you set aside plenty of time to complete it.
Once you have completed the Form DS-160, you will need to schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, unless you are under 13 years of age or over 80 years of age. The U.S. Department of State says you should schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country where you live. You may schedule your interview at another U.S. embassy or consulate, but be aware that it may be more difficult to qualify for a visa outside of the country where you live.
Prior to your interview, you will need to pay the $185 application fee and also, depending on your nationality, pay an issuance fee, as well. The visa issuance fee is only due after your interview, if your visa is approved. The next step will be an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate.
Visa wait times can vary depending on the time of year and location. You can use the appointment wait time tool to see how long you will have to wait for an appointment at a specific U.S. embassy or consulate.
At this stage, it is important to note that F-1 visas for new students can only be issued up to 365 days (one year) in advance of the start date for a course of study. It used to be 120 days, but in February, 2023, the State Department extended the period.
Note: For existing F-1 visas, this is not the case and visas can be issued any time, as long as the student is currently enrolled at a SEVP-approved school or institution and in SEVIS.
Boundless not only makes it easy for you to complete your F-1 student visa application, but we can also help you get ready for your visa interview. Learn more about what you get with Boundless.
You will generally be required to attend an interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate. You will need to bring:
You should also be prepared to bring evidence of:
During your interview, the consular officer will ask you questions to determine whether or not to approve your F-1 visa. Make sure you are complete and accurate in your answers, as you will be under oath. For interview tips, see the Boundless guide on preparing for the F-1 student visa interview.
The consular officer will also take your fingerprints, although this will vary depending on your location. After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing. The consular officer will let you know if this is required.
Once your interview is complete, you will be informed of the outcome and, if successful, be issued a visa to study in the United States.
Get exclusive visa interview prep materials from a former U.S. consular officer when you work with Boundless on your student visa application. Learn more.
Yes, you can bring your spouse and children with you. Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
F-1 students cannot work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students can engage in three types of off-campus employment:
This depends on your individual taxation situation, but typically you might be required to file a U.S. tax return. For more information, seek advice from a qualified tax professional.
Generally, an F-1 student may transfer between SEVP-certified schools. However, this does involve paperwork and coordination. See here for more detailed instructions.
There are some programs and visas available for F-1 visa holders after you finish studying in the United States. These can be highly individual to your circumstances, field of study, and professional background, so do your research carefully.

You don’t have to navigate the F-1 student visa process alone. Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have along the way. Learn more about what we do to help.

(3) General requirements. (i) Every nonimmigrant alien who applies for admission to, or an extension of stay in, the United States, must establish that he or she is admissible to the United States, or that any ground of inadmissibility has been waived under section 212(d)(3) of the Act. Upon application for admission, the alien must present a valid passport and valid visa unless either or both documents have been waived. A nonimmigrant alien's admission to the United States is conditioned on compliance with any inspection requirement in §235.1(d) or of this chapter. The passport of an alien applying for admission must be valid for a minimum of six months from the expiration date of the contemplated period of stay, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, and the alien must agree to abide by the terms and conditions of his or her admission. An alien applying for extension of stay must present a passport only if requested to do so by the Department of Homeland Security. The passport of an alien applying for extension of stay must be valid at the time of application for extension, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, and the alien must agree to maintain the validity of his or her passport and to abide by all the terms and conditions of his extension.
(ii) At the time of admission or extension of stay, every nonimmigrant alien must also agree to depart the United States at the expiration of his or her authorized period of admission or extension of stay, or upon abandonment of his or her authorized nonimmigrant status, and to comply with the departure procedures at section 215.8 of this chapter if such procedures apply to the particular alien. The nonimmigrant alien's failure to comply with those departure requirements, including any requirement that the alien provide biometric identifiers, may constitute a failure of the alien to maintain the terms of his or her nonimmigrant status.
(iii) At the time a nonimmigrant alien applies for admission or extension of stay, he or she must post a bond on Form I-352 in the sum of not less than $500, to ensure the maintenance of his or her nonimmigrant status and departure from the United States, if required to do so by the Commissioner of CBP, the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an immigration judge, or the Board of Immigration Appeals.
(b) Readmission of nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15) (F), (J), (M), or (Q)(ii) to complete unexpired periods of previous admission or extension of stay—(1) Section 101(a)(15)(F). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for duration of status as defined in §214.2(f)(5)(iii), any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(F) of the Act, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United States not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory or adjacent islands;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the requirement for presentation of a passport; and
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, an Arrival-Departure Record, Form I-94 (see §1.4), issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay, the alien's Form I-20 ID copy, and either:
(A) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20A-B if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20A since the form was initially issued; or
(B) A new Form I-20A-B if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20A since the form was initially issued.
(2) Section 101(a)(15)(J). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's departure, any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United States not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory or adjacent islands;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the requirement for the presentation of a passport; and
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, Form I-94 issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay or copy three of the last Form IAP-66 issued to the alien. Form I-94 or Form IAP-66 must show the unexpired period of the alien's stay endorsed by the Service.
(3) Section 101(a)(15)(M). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's departure, any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(M) of the Act, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the requirement for presentation of a passport; and
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, Form I-94 issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay, the alien's Form I-20 ID copy, and a properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N.
(4) Section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's departure, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United States not exceeding 30 days solely in contiguous territory or adjacent islands;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport;
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, an Arrival-Departure Record, Form I-94, issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay. The principal alien must also present a Certification Letter issued by the Department of State's Program Administrator.
(c) Extensions of stay—(1) Filing on Form I-129. An employer seeking the services of an E-1, E-2, H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, H-3, L-1, O-1, O-2, P-1, P-2, P-3, Q-1, R-1, or TN nonimmigrant beyond the period previously granted, must petition for an extension of stay on Form I-129. The petition must be filed with the fee required in §103.7 of this chapter, and the initial evidence specified in §214.2, and on the petition form. Dependents holding derivative status may be included in the petition if it is for only one worker and the form version specifically provides for their inclusion. In all other cases dependents of the worker should file on Form I-539.
(2) Filing on Form I-539. Any other nonimmigrant alien, except an alien in F or J status who has been granted duration of status, who seeks to extend his or her stay beyond the currently authorized period of admission, must apply for an extension of stay on Form I-539 with the fee required in §103.7 of this chapter together with any initial evidence specified in the applicable provisions of §214.2, and on the application form. More than one person may be included in an application where the co-applicants are all members of a single family group and either all hold the same nonimmigrant status or one holds a nonimmigrant status and the other co-applicants are his or her spouse and/or children who hold derivative nonimmigrant status based on his or her status. Extensions granted to members of a family group must be for the same period of time. The shortest period granted to any member of the family shall be granted to all members of the family. In order to be eligible for an extension of stay, nonimmigrant aliens in K-3/K-4 status must do so in accordance with §214.2(k)(10).
(3) Ineligible for extension of stay. A nonimmigrant in any of the following classes is ineligible for an extension of stay:
(i) B-1 or B-2 where admission was pursuant to the Visa Waiver Pilot Program;
(ii) C-1, C-2, C-3;
(iii) D-1, D-2;
(iv) K-1, K-2;
(v) Any nonimmigrant admitted for duration of status, other than as provided in §214.2(f)(7);
(vi) Any nonimmigrant who is classified pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act beyond a total of 3 years; or
(vii) Any nonimmigrant who is classified according to section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii) of the Act beyond a total of 3 years.
(viii) Any nonimmigrant admitted pursuant to the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program, as provided in section 212(l) of the Act.
(4) Timely filing and maintenance of status. An extension of stay may not be approved for an applicant who failed to maintain the previously accorded status or where such status expired before the application or petition was filed, except that failure to file before the period of previously authorized status expired may be excused in the discretion of the Service and without separate application, with any extension granted from the date the previously authorized stay expired, where it is demonstrated at the time of filing that:
(i) The delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the applicant or petitioner, and the Service finds the delay commensurate with the circumstances;
(ii) The alien has not otherwise violated his or her nonimmigrant status;
(iii) The alien remains a bona fide nonimmigrant; and
(iv) The alien is not the subject of deportation proceedings under section 242 of the Act (prior to April 1, 1997) or removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act.
(5) Decision in Form I-129 or I-539 extension proceedings. Where an applicant or petitioner demonstrates eligibility for a requested extension, it may be granted at the discretion of the Service. There is no appeal from the denial of an application for extension of stay filed on Form I-129 or I-539.
(d) Termination of status. Within the period of initial admission or extension of stay, the nonimmigrant status of an alien shall be terminated by the revocation of a waiver authorized on his or her behalf under section 212(d) (3) or (4) of the Act; by the introduction of a private bill to confer permanent resident status on such alien; or, pursuant to notification in the Federal Register, on the basis of national security, diplomatic, or public safety reasons.
(e) Employment. A nonimmigrant in the United States in a class defined in section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Act as a temporary visitor for pleasure, or section 101(a)(15)(C) of the Act as an alien in transit through this country, may not engage in any employment. Any other nonimmigrant in the United States may not engage in any employment unless he has been accorded a nonimmigrant classification which authorizes employment or he has been granted permission to engage in employment in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. A nonimmigrant who is permitted to engage in employment may engage only in such employment as has been authorized. Any unauthorized employment by a nonimmigrant constitutes a failure to maintain status within the meaning of section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
(f) Registration and false information. A nonimmigrant's admission and continued stay in the United States is conditioned on compliance with any registration, photographing, and fingerprinting requirements under §264.1(f) of this chapter that relate to the maintenance of nonimmigrant status and also on the full and truthful disclosure of all information requested by the Service. Willful failure by a nonimmigrant to register or to provide full and truthful information requested by the Service (regardless of whether or not the information requested was material) constitutes a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status under section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)).
(g) Criminal activity. A condition of a nonimmigrant's admission and continued stay in the United States is obedience to all laws of United States jurisdictions which prohibit the commission of crimes of violence and for which a sentence of more than one year imprisonment may be imposed. A nonimmigrant's conviction in a jurisdiction in the United States for a crime of violence for which a sentence of more than one year imprisonment may be imposed (regardless of whether such sentence is in fact imposed) constitutes a failure to maintain status under section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
(h) Education privacy and F, J, and M nonimmigrants. As authorized by section 641(c)(2) of Division C of Pub. L. 104-208, 8 U.S.C. 1372, and §2.1(a) of this chapter, the Service has determined that, with respect to F and M nonimmigrant students and J nonimmigrant exchange visitors, waiving the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. 1232g, is necessary for the proper implementation of 8 U.S.C. 1372. An educational agency or institution may not refuse to report information concerning an F or M nonimmigrant student or a J nonimmigrant exchange visitor that the educational agency or institution is required to report under 8 U.S.C. 1372 and §214.3(g) (or any corresponding Department of State regulation concerning J nonimmigrants) on the basis of FERPA and any regulation implementing FERPA. The waiver of FERPA under this paragraph authorizes and requires an educational agency or institution to report information concerning an F, J or M nonimmigrant that would ordinarily be protected by FERPA, but only to the extent that 8 U.S.C. 1372 and §214.3(g) (or any corresponding Department of State regulation concerning J nonimmigrants) requires the educational agency or institution to report information.
(i) Employment in a health care occupation. (1) Except as provided in 8 CFR 212.15(n), any alien described in 8 CFR 212.15(a) who is coming to the United States to perform labor in a health care occupation described in 8 CFR 212.15(c) must obtain a certificate from a credentialing organization described in 8 CFR 212.15(e). The certificate or certified statement must be presented to the Department of Homeland Security in accordance with 8 CFR 212.15(d). In the alternative, an eligible alien seeking admission as a nurse may obtain a certified statement as provided in 8 CFR 212.15(h).
(2) A TN nonimmigrant may establish that he or she is eligible for a waiver described at 8 CFR 212.15(n) by providing evidence that his or her initial admission as a TN (or TC) nonimmigrant health care worker occurred before September 23, 2003, and he or she was licensed and employed in the United States as a health care worker before September 23, 2003. Evidence may include, but is not limited to, copies of TN or TC approval notices, copies of Form I-94 Arrival/Departure Records, employment verification letters and/or pay-stubs or other employment records, and state health care worker licenses.
(j) Extension of stay or change of status for health care worker. In the case of any alien admitted temporarily as a nonimmigrant under section 212(d)(3) of the Act and 8 CFR 212.15(n) for the primary purpose of the providing labor in a health care occupation described in 8 CFR 212.15(c), the petitioning employer may file a Form I-129 to extend the approval period for the alien's classification for the nonimmigrant status. If the alien is in the United States and is eligible for an extension of stay or change of status, the Form I-129 also serves as an application to extend the period of the alien's authorized stay or to change the alien's status. Although the Form I-129 petition may be approved, as it relates to the employer's request to classify the alien, the application for an extension of stay or change of status shall be denied if:
(1) The petitioner or applicant fails to submit the certification required by 8 CFR 212.15(a) with the petition or application to extend the alien's stay or change the alien's status; or
(2) The petition or application to extend the alien's stay or change the alien's status does include the certification required by 8 CFR 212.15(a), but the alien obtained the certification more than 1 year after the date of the alien's admission under section 212(d)(3) of the Act and 8 CFR 212.15(n). While DHS may admit, extend the period of authorized stay, or change the status of a nonimmigrant health care worker for a period of 1 year if the alien does not have certification on or before July 26, 2004 (or on or before July 26, 2005, in the case of a citizen of Canada or Mexico, who, before September 23, 2003, was employed as a TN or TC nonimmigrant health care worker and held a valid license from a U.S. jurisdiction), the alien will not be eligible for a subsequent admission, change of status, or extension of stay as a health care worker if the alien has not obtained the requisite certification 1 year after the initial date of admission, change of status, or extension of stay as a health care worker.
(k) Denial of petitions under section 214(c) of the Act based on a finding by the Department of Labor. Upon debarment by the Department of Labor pursuant to 20 CFR part 655, USCIS may deny any petition filed by that petitioner for nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(H) (except for status under sections 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1)), (L), (O), and (P)(i) of the Act) for a period of at least 1 year but not more than 5 years. The length of the period shall be based on the severity of the violation or violations. The decision to deny petitions, the time period for the bar to petitions, and the reasons for the time period will be explained in a written notice to the petitioner.

(f) Students in colleges, universities, seminaries, conservatories, academic high schools, elementary schools, other academic institutions, and in language training programs—(1) Admission of student—(i) Eligibility for admission. A nonimmigrant student may be admitted into the United States in nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(F) of the Act, if:
(A) The student presents a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in his or her own name by a school approved by the Service for attendance by F-1 foreign students. (In the alternative, for a student seeking admission prior to August 1, 2003, the student may present a currently-valid Form I-20A-B/I-20ID, if that form was issued by the school prior to January 30, 2003);
(B) The student has documentary evidence of financial support in the amount indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20A-B/I-20ID);
(C) For students seeking initial admission only, the student intends to attend the school specified in the student's visa (or, where the student is exempt from the requirement for a visa, the school indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20A-B/I-20ID)); and
(D) In the case of a student who intends to study at a public secondary school, the student has demonstrated that he or she has reimbursed the local educational agency that administers the school for the full, unsubsidized per capita cost of providing education at the school for the period of the student's attendance.
(ii) Disposition of Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID. Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID contains two copies, the I-20 School Copy and the I-20 ID (Student) Copy. For purposes of clarity, the entire Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID shall be referred to as Form I-20 A-B and the I-20 ID (Student) Copy shall be referred to as the I-20 ID. When an F-1 student applies for admission with a complete Form I-20 A-B, the inspecting officer shall:
(A) Transcribe the student's admission number from Form I-94 onto his or her Form I-20 A-B (for students seeking initial admission only);
(B) Endorse all copies of the Form I-20 A-B;
(C) Return the I-20 ID to the student; and
(D) Forward the I-20 School Copy to the Service's processing center for data entry. (The school copy of Form I-20 A-B will be sent back to the school as a notice of the student's admission after data entry.)
(iii) Use of SEVIS. On January 30, 2003, the use of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) will become mandatory for the issuance of any new Form I-20. A student or dependent who presents a non-SEVIS Form I-20 issued on or after January 30, 2003, will not be accepted for admission to the United States. Non-SEVIS Forms I-20 issued prior to January 30, 2003, will continue to be acceptable until August 1, 2003. However, schools must issue a SEVIS Form I-20 to any current student requiring a reportable action (e.g., extension of status, practical training, and requests for employment authorization) or a new Form I-20, or for any aliens who must obtain a new nonimmigrant student visa. As of August 1, 2003, the records of all current or continuing students must be entered in SEVIS.
(2) I-20 ID. An F-1 student is expected to safekeep the initial I-20 ID bearing the admission number and any subsequent copies which have been issued to him or her. Should the student lose his or her current I-20 ID, a replacement copy bearing the same information as the lost copy, including any endorsement for employment and notations, may be issued by the designated school official (DSO) as defined in 8 CFR 214.3(l)(1)(i).
(3) Admission of the spouse and minor children of an F-1 student. The spouse and minor children accompanying an F-1 student are eligible for admission in F-2 status if the student is admitted in F-1 status. The spouse and minor children following-to-join an F-1 student are eligible for admission to the United States in F-2 status if they are able to demonstrate that the F-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study, or engaged in approved practical training following completion of studies. In either case, at the time they seek admission, the eligible spouse and minor children of an F-1 student with a SEVIS Form I-20 must individually present an original SEVIS Form I-20 issued in the name of each F-2 dependent issued by a school authorized by the Service for attendance by F-1 foreign students. Prior to August 1, 2003, if exigent circumstances are demonstrated, the Service will allow the dependent of an F-1 student in possession of a SEVIS Form I-20 to enter the United States using a copy of the F-1 student's SEVIS Form I-20. (In the alternative, for dependents seeking admission to the United States prior to August 1, 2003, a copy of the F-1 student's current Form I-20ID issued prior to January 30, 2003, with proper endorsement by the DSO will satisfy this requirement.) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or Form I-20A-B) is required for a dependent where there has been any substantive change in the F-1 student's current information.
(4) Temporary absence. An F-1 student returning to the United States from a temporary absence of five months or less may be readmitted for attendance at a Service-approved educational institution, if the student presents:
(i) A current SEVIS Form I-20 (or, for readmission prior to August 1, 2003, a current Form I-20ID which was issued prior to January 30, 2003), properly endorsed by the DSO for reentry if there has been no substantive change to the most recent Form I-20 information; or
(ii) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or, for readmission prior to August 1, 2003, a new Form I-20ID which was issued prior to January 30, 2003), if there has been a substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20 information, such as in the case of a student who has changed the major area of study, who intends to transfer to another Service approved institution or who has advanced to a higher level of study.
(5) Duration of status—(i) General. Except for border commuter students covered by the provisions of paragraph (f)(18) of this section, an F-1 student is admitted for duration of status. Duration of status is defined as the time during which an F-1 student is pursuing a full course of study at an educational institution approved by the Service for attendance by foreign students, or engaging in authorized practical training following completion of studies, except that an F-1 student who is admitted to attend a public high school is restricted to an aggregate of 12 months of study at any public high school(s). An F-1 student may be admitted for a period up to 30 days before the indicated report date or program start date listed on Form I-20. The student is considered to be maintaining status if he or she is making normal progress toward completing a course of study.

(ii) Change in educational levels. An F-1 student who continues from one educational level to another is considered to be maintaining status, provided that the transition to the new educational level is accomplished according to transfer procedures outlined in paragraph (f)(8) of this section.
(iii) Annual vacation. An F-1 student at an academic institution is considered to be in status during the annual (or summer) vacation if the student is eligible and intends to register for the next term. A student attending a school on a quarter or trimester calendar who takes only one vacation a year during any one of the quarters or trimesters instead of during the summer is considered to be in status during that vacation, if the student has completed the equivalent of an academic year prior to taking the vacation.
(iv) Preparation for departure. An F-1 student who has completed a course of study and any authorized practical training following completion of studies will be allowed an additional 60-day period to prepare for departure from the United States or to transfer in accordance with paragraph (f)(8) of this section. An F-1 student authorized by the DSO to withdraw from classes will be allowed a 15-day period for departure from the United States. However, an F-1 student who fails to maintain a full course of study without the approval of the DSO or otherwise fails to maintain status is not eligible for an additional period for departure.
(v) Emergent circumstances as determined by the Commissioner. Where the Commissioner has suspended the applicability of any or all of the requirements for on-campus or off-campus employment authorization for specified students pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9)(i) or (f)(9)(ii) of this section by notice in the Federal Register, an affected student who needs to reduce his or her full course of study as a result of accepting employment authorized by such notice in the Federal Register will be considered to be in status during the authorized employment, subject to any other conditions specified in the notice, provided that, for the duration of the authorized employment, the student is registered for the number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term specified in the notice, which in no event shall be less than 6 semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term if the student is at the undergraduate level or less than 3 semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term if the student is at the graduate level, and is continuing to make progress toward completing the course of study.
(vi) Extension of duration of status and grant of employment authorization.
(A) The duration of status, and any employment authorization granted under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B) and (C), of an F-1 student who is the beneficiary of an H-1B petition and request for change of status shall be automatically extended until October 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1B visa is being requested where such petition:
(1) Has been timely filed; and
(2) States that the employment start date for the F-1 student is October 1 of the following fiscal year.
(B) The automatic extension of an F-1 student's duration of status and employment authorization under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section shall immediately terminate upon the rejection, denial, or revocation of the H-1B petition filed on such F-1 student's behalf.
(C) In order to obtain the automatic extension of stay and employment authorization under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, the F-1 student, according to 8 CFR part 248, must not have violated the terms or conditions of his or her nonimmigrant status.
(D) An automatic extension of an F-1 student's duration of status under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section also applies to the duration of status of any F-2 dependent aliens.

(6) Full course of study—(i) General. Successful completion of the full course of study must lead to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective. A course of study at an institution not approved for attendance by foreign students as provided in §214.3(a)(3) does not satisfy this requirement. A “full course of study” as required by section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act means:
(A) Postgraduate study or postdoctoral study at a college or university, or undergraduate or postgraduate study at a conservatory or religious seminary, certified by a DSO as a full course of study;
(B) Undergraduate study at a college or university, certified by a school official to consist of at least twelve semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter hour systems, where all undergraduate students who are enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or are considered full-time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the district director in the school approval process), except when the student needs a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term;
(C) Study in a postsecondary language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other non-vocational program at a school which confers upon its graduates recognized associate or other degrees or has established that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning which are either: (1) A school (or school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof; or (2) a school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; and which has been certified by a designated school official to consist of at least twelve clock hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by the district director in the school approval process;
(D) Study in any other language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other nonvocational training program, certified by a designated school official to consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or to consist of at least twenty-two clock hours a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of laboratory work; or
(E) Study in a curriculum at an approved private elementary or middle school or public or private academic high school which is certified by a designated school official to consist of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress toward graduation.
(F) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) and (f)(6)(i)(B) of this section, an alien who has been granted employment authorization pursuant to the terms of a document issued by the Commissioner under paragraphs (f)(9)(i) or (f)(9)(ii) of this section and published in the Federal Register shall be deemed to be engaged in a “full course of study” if he or she remains registered for no less than the number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term specified by the Commissioner in the notice for the validity period of such employment authorization.

(G) For F-1 students enrolled in classes for credit or classroom hours, no more than the equivalent of one class or three credits per session, term, semester, trimester, or quarter may be counted toward the full course of study requirement if the class is taken on-line or through distance education and does not require the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to completion of the class. An on-line or distance education course is a course that is offered principally through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing. If the F-1 student's course of study is in a language study program, no on-line or distance education classes may be considered to count toward a student's full course of study requirement.
(H) On-campus employment pursuant to the terms of a scholarship, fellowship, or assistantship is deemed to be part of the academic program of a student otherwise taking a full course of study.
(ii) Institution of higher learning. For purposes of this paragraph, a college or university is an institution of higher learning which awards recognized associate, bachelor's, master's, doctorate, or professional degrees. Schools which devote themselves exclusively or primarily to vocational, business, or language instruction are not included in the category of colleges or universities. Vocational or business schools which are classifiable as M-1 schools are provided for by regulations under 8 CFR 214.2(m).
(iii) Reduced course load. The designated school official may allow an F-1 student to engage in less than a full course of study as provided in this paragraph (f)(6)(iii). Except as otherwise noted, a reduced course load must consist of at least six semester or quarter hours, or half the clock hours required for a full course of study. A student who drops below a full course of study without the prior approval of the DSO will be considered out of status. On-campus employment pursuant to the terms of a scholarship, fellowship, or assistantship is deemed to be part of the academic program of a student otherwise taking a full course of study.
(A) Academic difficulties. The DSO may authorize a reduced course load on account of a student's initial difficulty with the English language or reading requirements, unfamiliarity with U.S. teaching methods, or improper course level placement. The student must resume a full course of study at the next available term, session, or semester, excluding a summer session, in order to maintain student status. A student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to academic difficulties is not eligible for a second authorization by the DSO due to academic difficulties while pursuing a course of study at that program level. A student authorized to drop below a full course of study for academic difficulties while pursuing a course of study at a particular program level may still be authorized for a reduced course load due to an illness medical condition as provided for in paragraph (B) of this section.
(B) Medical conditions. The DSO may authorize a reduced course load (or, if necessary, no course load) due to a student's temporary illness or medical condition for a period of time not to exceed an aggregate of 12 months while the student is pursuing a course of study at a particular program level. In order to authorize a reduced course load based upon a medical condition, the student must provide medical documentation from a licensed medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or licensed clinical psychologist, to the DSO to substantiate the illness or medical condition. The student must provide current medical documentation and the DSO must reauthorize the drop below full course of study each new term, session, or semester. A student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to illness or medical condition for an aggregate of 12 months may not be authorized by a DSO to reduce his or her course load on subsequent occasions while pursuing a course of study at the same program level. A student may be authorized to reduce course load for a reason of illness or medical condition on more than one occasion while pursuing a course of study, so long as the aggregate period of that authorization does not exceed 12 months.
(C) Completion of course of study. The DSO may authorize a reduced course load in the student's final term, semester, or session if fewer courses are needed to complete the course of study. If the student is not required to take any additional courses to satisfy the requirements for completion, but continues to be enrolled for administrative purposes, the student is considered to have completed the course of study and must take action to maintain status. Such action may include application for change of status or departure from the U.S.
(D) Reporting requirements for non-SEVIS schools. A DSO must report to the Service any student who is authorized to reduce his or her course load. Within 21 days of the authorization, the DSO must send a photocopy of the student's current Form I-20ID along with Form I-538 to Service's data processing center indicating the date and reason that the student was authorized to drop below full time status. Similarly, the DSO will report to the Service no more than 21 days after the student has resumed a full course of study by submitting a current copy of the students' Form I-20ID to the Service's data processing center indicating the date a full course of study was resumed and the new program end date with Form I-538, if applicable.
(E) SEVIS reporting requirements. In order for a student to be authorized to drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS prior to the student reducing his or her course load. The DSO must update SEVIS with the date, reason for authorization, and the start date of the next term or session. The DSO must also notify SEVIS within 21 days of the student's commencement of a full course of study. If an extension of the program end date is required due to the drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS by completing a new SEVIS Form I-20 with the new program end date in accordance with paragraph (f)(7) of this section.

(iv) Concurrent enrollment. An F-1 student may be enrolled in two different Service-approved schools at one time as long as the combined enrollment amounts to a full time course of study. In cases where a student is concurrently enrolled, the school from which the student will earn his or her degree or certification should issue the Form I-20, and conduct subsequent certifications and updates to the Form I-20. The DSO from this school is also responsible for all of the reporting requirements to the Service. In instances where a student is enrolled in programs with different full course of study requirements (e.g., clock hours vs. credit hours), the DSO is permitted to determine what constitutes a full time course of study.
(7) Extension of stay—(i) General. An F-1 student who is admitted for duration of status is not required to apply for extension of stay as long as the student is maintaining status and making normal progress toward completion of his or her educational objective. An F-1 student who is currently maintaining status and making normal progress toward completing his or her educational objective, but who is unable to complete his or her course of study by the program end date on the Form I-20, must apply prior to the program end date for a program extension pursuant to paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section.
(ii) Report date and program completion date on Form I-20. When determining the report date on the Form I-20, the DSO may choose a reasonable date to accommodate a student's need to be in attendance for required activities at the school prior to the actual start of classes. Such required activities may include, but are not limited to, research projects and orientation sessions. However, for purposes of employment, the DSO may not indicate a report date more than 30 days prior to the start of classes. When determining the program completion date on Form I-20, the DSO should make a reasonable estimate based upon the time an average student would need to complete a similar program in the same discipline.
(iii) Program extension for students in lawful status. An F-1 student who is unable to meet the program completion date on the Form I-20 may be granted an extension by the DSO if the DSO certifies that the student has continually maintained status and that the delays are caused by compelling academic or medical reasons, such as changes of major or research topics, unexpected research problems, or documented illnesses. Delays caused by academic probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program extensions. A DSO may not grant an extension if the student did not apply for an extension until after the program end date noted on the Form I-20. An F-1 student who is unable to complete the educational program within the time listed on Form I-20 and who is ineligible for program extension pursuant to this paragraph (f)(7) is considered out of status. If eligible, the student may apply for reinstatement under the provisions of paragraph (f)(16) of this section.
(iv) Notification. Upon granting a program extension, a DSO at a non-SEVIS school must immediately submit notification to the Service's data processing center using Form I-538 and the top page of Form I-20A-B showing the new program completion date. For a school enrolled in SEVIS, a DSO may grant a program extension only by updating SEVIS and issuing a new Form I-20 reflecting the current program end date. A DSO may grant an extension any time prior to the program end date listed on the student's original Form I-20.

(8) School transfer. (i) A student who is maintaining status may transfer to another Service approved school by following the notification procedure prescribed in paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section. However, an F-1 student is not permitted to remain in the United States when transferring between schools or programs unless the student will begin classes at the transfer school or program within 5 months of transferring out of the current school or within 5 months of the program completion date on his or her current Form I-20, whichever is earlier. In the case of an F-1 student authorized to engage in post-completion optional practical training (OPT), the student must be able resume classes within 5 months of transferring out of the school that recommended OPT or the date the OPT authorization ends, whichever is earlier. An F-1 student who was not pursuing a full course of study at the school he or she was last authorized to attend is ineligible for school transfer and must apply for reinstatement under the provisions of paragraph (f)(16) of this section, or, in the alternative, may depart the country and return as an initial entry in a new F-1 nonimmigrant status.
(ii) Transfer procedure. To transfer schools, an F-1 student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a Form I-20 A-B, issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k), from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. The transfer will be effected only if the F-1 student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 A-B and returns the form to a designated school official on campus within 15 days of beginning attendance at the new school.
(A) Non-SEVIS School to Non-SEVIS school. To transfer from one non-SEVIS school to a different non-SEVIS school, the student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a Form I-20 issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k) from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Prior to issuance of any Form I-20, the DSO at the transfer school is responsible for determining that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school and is eligible for transfer to the new school. The transfer will be effected only if the student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 and returns the form to a DSO of the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on Form I-20. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 the DSO must note “transfer completed on (date)” in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance at the transfer school; return the Form I-20 to the student; submit the School copy of the Form I-20 to Service's Data Processing Center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and forward a photocopy of the school copy to the school from which the student transferred.
(B) Non-SEVIS school to SEVIS school. To transfer from a non-SEVIS school to a SEVIS school, the student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k) from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Prior to issuance of any Form I-20, the DSO at the transfer school is responsible for determining that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school and is eligible for transfer to the new school. Once the transfer school has issued the SEVIS Form I-20 to the student indicating a transfer, the transfer school becomes responsible for updating and maintaining the student's record in SEVIS. The student is then required to notify the DSO at the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on SEVIS Form I-20. Upon notification that the student is enrolled in classes, the DSO of the transfer school must update SEVIS to reflect the student's registration and current address, thereby acknowledging that the student has completed the transfer process. In the remarks section of the student's SEVIS Form I-20, the DSO must note that the transfer has been completed, including the date, and return the form to the student. The transfer is effected when the transfer school updates SEVIS indicating that the student has registered in classes within the 30 days required by §214.3(g)(3)(iii).
(C) SEVIS school to SEVIS school. To transfer from a SEVIS school to a SEVIS school the student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and must indicate the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school will update the student's record in SEVIS as a “transfer out” and indicate the school to which the student intends to transfer, and a release date. The release date will be the current semester or session completion date, or the date of expected transfer if earlier than the established academic cycle. The current school will retain control over the student's record in SEVIS until the student completes the current term or reaches the release date. At the request of the student, the DSO of the current school may cancel the transfer request at any time prior to the release date. As of the release date specified by the current DSO, the transfer school will be granted full access to the student's SEVIS record and then becomes responsible for that student. The current school conveys authority and responsibility over that student to the transfer school, and will no longer have full SEVIS access to that student's record. As such, a transfer request may not be cancelled by the current DSO after the release date has been reached. After the release date, the transfer DSO must complete the transfer of the student's record in SEVIS and may issue a SEVIS Form I-20. The student is then required to contact the DSO at the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on the SEVIS Form I-20. Upon notification that the student is enrolled in classes, the DSO of the transfer school must update SEVIS to reflect the student's registration and current address, thereby acknowledging that the student has completed the transfer process. In the remarks section of the student's SEVIS Form I-20, the DSO must note that the transfer has been completed, including the date, and return the form to the student. The transfer is effected when the transfer school notifies SEVIS that the student has enrolled in classes in accordance with the 30 days required by §214.3(g)(3)(iii).
(D) SEVIS school to non-SEVIS school. To transfer from a SEVIS school to a non-SEVIS school, the student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and must indicate the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school will update the student's status in SEVIS as “a transfer out”, enter a “release” or expected transfer date, and update the transfer school as “non-SEVIS.” The student must then notify the school to which the he or she intends to transfer of his or her intent to enroll. After the student has completed his or her current term or session, or has reached the expected transfer date, the DSO at the current school will no longer have full access to the student's SEVIS record. At this point, if the student has notified the transfer school of his or her intent to transfer, and the transfer school has determined that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school, the transfer school may issue the student a Form I-20. The transfer will be effected only if the student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 and returns the form to a designated school official of the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on Form I-20. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 the DSO must do as follows: note “transfer completed on (date)” in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance; return the Form I-20 to the student; submit the school copy of the Form I-20 to the Service's data processing center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and forward a photocopy of the school copy to the school from which the student transferred.
(iii) Notification. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 A-B, the DSO must:
(A) Note “transfer completed on (date)” on the student's I-20 ID in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance;
(B) Return the I-20 ID to the student;
(C) Submit the I-20 School copy to the Service's Data Processing Center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and
(D) Forward a photocopy of the Form I-20 A-B School Copy to the school from which the student transferred.
(9) Employment—(i) On-campus employment. On-campus employment must either be performed on the school's premises, (including on-location commercial firms which provide services for students on campus, such as the school bookstore or cafeteria), or at an off-campus location which is educationally affiliated with the school. Employment with on-site commercial firms, such as a construction company building a school building, which do not provide direct student services is not deemed on-campus employment for the purposes of this paragraph. In the case of off-campus locations, the educational affiliation must be associated with the school's established curriculum or related to contractually funded research projects at the post-graduate level. In any event, the employment must be an integral part of the student's educational program. Employment authorized under this paragraph must not exceed 20 hours a week while school is in session, unless the Commissioner suspends the applicability of this limitation due to emergent circumstances, as determined by the Commissioner, by means of notice in the Federal Register, the student demonstrates to the DSO that the employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship resulting from the emergent circumstances, and the DSO notates the Form I-20 in accordance with the Federal Register document. An F-1 student may, however, work on campus full-time when school is not in session or during the annual vacation. A student who has been issued a Form I-20 A-B to begin a new program in accordance with the provision of 8 CFR 214.3(k) and who intends to enroll for the next regular academic year, term, or session at the institution which issued the Form I-20 A-B may continue on-campus employment incident to status. Otherwise, an F-1 student may not engage in on-campus employment after completing a course of study, except employment for practical training as authorized under paragraph (f)(10) of this section. An F-I student may engage in any on-campus employment authorized under this paragraph which will not displace United States residents. In the case of a transfer in SEVIS, the student may only engage in on-campus employment at the school having jurisdiction over the student's SEVIS record. Upon initial entry to begin a new course of study, an F-1 student may not begin on-campus employment more than 30 days prior to the actual start of classes.
(ii) Off-campus work authorization—(A) General. An F-1 student may be authorized to work off-campus on a part-time basis in accordance with paragraph (f)(9)(ii) (B) or (C) of this section after having been in F-1 status for one full academic year provided that the student is in good academic standing as determined by the DSO. Part-time off-campus employment authorized under this section is limited to no more than twenty hours a week when school is in session. A student who is granted off-campus employment authorization may work full-time during holidays or school vacation. The employment authorization is automatically terminated whenever the student fails to maintain status. In emergent circumstances as determined by the Commissioner, the Commissioner may suspend the applicability of any or all of the requirements of paragraph (f)(9)(ii) of this section by notice in the Federal Register.
(B) [Reserved]
(C) Severe economic hardship. If other employment opportunities are not available or are otherwise insufficient, an eligible F-1 student may request off-campus employment work authorization based upon severe economic hardship caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the student's control. These circumstances may include loss of financial aid or on-campus employment without fault on the part of the student, substantial fluctuations in the value of currency or exchange rate, inordinate increases in tuition and/or living costs, unexpected changes in the financial condition of the student's source of support, medical bills, or other substantial and unexpected expenses.
(D) Procedure for off-campus employment authorization due to severe economic hardship. The student must request a recommendation from the DSO for off-campus employment. The DSO at a non-SEVIS school must make such a certification on Form I-538, Certification by Designated School Official. The DSO of a SEVIS school must complete such certification in SEVIS. The DSO may recommend the student for work off-campus for one year intervals by certifying that:
(1) The student has been in F-1 status for one full academic year;
(2) The student is in good standing as a student and is carrying a full course of study as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section;
(3) The student has demonstrated that acceptance of employment will not interfere with the student's carrying a full course of study; and
(4) The student has demonstrated that the employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the student's control pursuant to paragraph (f)(9)(ii)(C) of this section and has demonstrated that employment under paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section is unavailable or otherwise insufficient to meet the needs that have arisen as a result of the unforeseen circumstances.
(E) [Reserved]
(F) Severe economic hardship application. (1) The applicant should submit the economic hardship application for employment authorization on Form I-765, with the fee required by 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), to the service center having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. Applicants at a non-SEVIS school should submit Form I-20, Form I-538, and any other supporting materials such as affidavits which further detail the unforeseen circumstances that require the student to seek employment authorization and the unavailability or insufficiency of employment under paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section. Students enrolled in a SEVIS school should submit the SEVIS Form I-20 with the employment page demonstrating the DSO's comments and certification.
(2) The Service shall adjudicate the application for work authorization based upon severe economic hardship on the basis of Form I-20 ID, Form I-538, and Form I-765, and any additional supporting materials. If employment is authorized, the adjudicating officer shall issue an EAD. The Service director shall notify the student of the decision, and, if the application is denied, of the reason or reasons for the denial. No appeal shall lie from a decision to deny a request for employment authorization under this section. The employment authorization may be granted in one year intervals up to the expected date of completion of the student's current course of study. A student has permission to engage in off-campus employment only if the student receives the EAD endorsed to that effect. Off-campus employment authorization may be renewed by the Service only if the student is maintaining status and good academic standing. The employment authorization is automatically terminated whenever the student fails to maintain status.
(iii) Internship with an international organization. A bona fide F-1 student who has been offered employment by a recognized international organization within the meaning of the International Organization Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669) must apply for employment authorization to the service center having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. A student seeking employment authorization under this provision is required to present a written certification from the international organization that the proposed employment is within the scope of the organization's sponsorship, Form I-20 ID or SEVIS Form I-20 with employment page completed by DSO certifying eligibility for employment, and a completed Form I-765, with required fee as contained in §103.7(b)(1) of this chapter.
(10) Practical training. Practical training may be authorized to an F-1 student who has been lawfully enrolled on a full time basis, in a Service-approved college, university, conservatory, or seminary for one full academic year. This provision also includes students who, during their course of study, were enrolled in a study abroad program, if the student had spent at least one full academic term enrolled in a full course of study in the United States prior to studying abroad. A student may be authorized 12 months of practical training, and becomes eligible for another 12 months of practical training when he or she changes to a higher educational level. Students in English language training programs are ineligible for practical training. An eligible student may request employment authorization for practical training in a position that is directly related to his or her major area of study. There are two types of practical training available:
(i) Curricular practical training. An F-1 student may be authorized by the DSO to participate in a curricular practical training program that is an integral part of an established curriculum. Curricular practical training is defined to be alternative work/study, internship, cooperative education, or any other type of required internship or practicum that is offered by sponsoring employers through cooperative agreements with the school. Students who have received one year or more of full time curricular practical training are ineligible for post-completion academic training. Exceptions to the one academic year requirement are provided for students enrolled in graduate studies that require immediate participation in curricular practical training. A request for authorization for curricular practical training must be made to the DSO. A student may begin curricular practical training only after receiving his or her Form I-20 with the DSO endorsement.
(A) Non-SEVIS process. A student must request authorization for curricular practical training using Form I-538. Upon approving the request for authorization, the DSO shall: certify Form I-538 and send the form to the Service's data processing center; endorse the student's Form I-20 ID with “full-time (or part-time) curricular practical training authorized for (employer) at (location) from (date) to (date)”; and sign and date the Form I-20ID before returning it to the student.
(B) SEVIS process. To grant authorization for a student to engage in curricular practical training, a DSO at a SEVIS school will update the student's record in SEVIS as being authorized for curricular practical training that is directly related to the student's major area of study. The DSO will indicate whether the training is full-time or part-time, the employer and location, and the employment start and end date. The DSO will then print a copy of the employment page of the SEVIS Form I-20 indicating that curricular practical training has been approved. The DSO must sign, date, and return the SEVIS Form I-20 to the student prior to the student's commencement of employment.
(ii) Optional practical training.

(A) General. Consistent with the application and approval process in paragraph (f)(11) of this section, a student may apply to USCIS for authorization for temporary employment for optional practical training directly related to the student's major area of study. The student may not begin optional practical training until the date indicated on his or her employment authorization document, Form I-766. A student may be granted authorization to engage in temporary employment for optional practical training:
(1) During the student's annual vacation and at other times when school is not in session, if the student is currently enrolled, and is eligible for registration and intends to register for the next term or session;
(2) While school is in session, provided that practical training does not exceed 20 hours a week while school is in session; or
(3) After completion of the course of study, or, for a student in a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree program, after completion of all course requirements for the degree (excluding thesis or equivalent). Continued enrollment, for the school's administrative purposes, after all requirements for the degree have been met does not preclude eligibility for optional practical training. A student must complete all practical training within a 14-month period following the completion of study, except that a 24-month extension pursuant to paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section does not need to be completed within such 14-month period.
(B) Termination of practical training. Authorization to engage in optional practical training employment is automatically terminated when the student transfers to another school or begins study at another educational level.
(C) 24-month extension of post-completion OPT for a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) degree. Consistent with paragraph (f)(11)(i)(C) of this section, a qualified student may apply for an extension of OPT while in a valid period of post-completion OPT authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). An extension will be for 24 months for the first qualifying degree for which the student has completed all course requirements (excluding thesis or equivalent), including any qualifying degree as part of a dual degree program, subject to the requirement in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(3) of this section that previously obtained degrees must have been conferred. If a student completes all such course requirements for another qualifying degree at a higher degree level than the first, the student may apply for a second 24-month extension of OPT while in a valid period of post-completion OPT authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). In no event may a student be authorized for more than two lifetime STEM OPT extensions. A student who was granted a 17-month OPT extension under the rule issued at 73 FR 18944, whether or not such student requests an additional 7-month period of STEM OPT under 8 CFR 214.16, is considered to have been authorized for one STEM OPT extension, and may be eligible for only one more STEM OPT extension. Any subsequent application for an additional 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) must be based on a degree at a higher degree level than the degree that was the basis for the student's first OPT extension. In order to qualify for an extension of post-completion OPT based upon a STEM degree, all of the following requirements must be met.
(1) Accreditation. The degree that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension is from a U.S. educational institution accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education at the time of application.
(2) DHS-approved degree. The degree that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension is a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in a field determined by the Secretary, or his or her designee, to qualify within a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics field.
(i) The term “science, technology, engineering or mathematics field” means a field included in the Department of Education's Classification of Instructional Programs taxonomy within the two-digit series or successor series containing engineering, biological sciences, mathematics, and physical sciences, or a related field. In general, related fields will include fields involving research, innovation, or development of new technologies using engineering, mathematics, computer science, or natural sciences (including physical, biological, and agricultural sciences).
(ii) The Secretary, or his or her designee, will maintain the STEM Designated Degree Program List, which will be a complete list of qualifying degree program categories, published on the Student and Exchange Visitor Program Web site at http://www.ice.gov/sevis. Changes that are made to the Designated Degree Program List may also be published in a notice in the Federal Register. All program categories included on the list must be consistent with the definition set forth in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2)(i) of this section.
(iii) At the time the DSO recommends a 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) in SEVIS, the degree that is the basis for the application for the OPT extension must be contained within a category on the STEM Designated Degree Program List.
(3) Previously obtained STEM degree(s). The degree that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) may be, but is not required to be, the degree that is the basis for the post-completion OPT period authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). If an application for a 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) is based upon a degree obtained previous to the degree that provided the basis for the period of post-completion OPT authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B), that previously obtained degree must have been conferred from a U.S. educational institution that is accredited and SEVP-certified at the time the student's DSO recommends the student for the 24-month OPT extension and must be in a degree program category included on the current STEM Designated Degree Program List at the time of the DSO recommendation. That previously obtained degree must have been conferred within the 10 years preceding the date the DSO recommends the student for the 24-month OPT extension.
(4) Eligible practical training opportunity. The STEM practical training opportunity that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) must be directly related to the degree that qualifies the student for such extension, which may be the previously obtained degree described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(3) of this section.
(5) Employer qualification. The student's employer is enrolled in E-Verify, as evidenced by either a valid E-Verify Company Identification number or, if the employer is using an employer agent to create its E-Verify cases, a valid E-Verify Client Company Identification number, and the employer remains a participant in good standing with E-Verify, as determined by USCIS. An employer must also have an employer identification number (EIN) used for tax purposes.
(6) Employer reporting. A student may not be authorized for employment with an employer pursuant to paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section unless the employer agrees, by signing the Training Plan for STEM OPT Students, Form I-983 or successor form, to report the termination or departure of an OPT student to the DSO at the student's school, if the termination or departure is prior to the end of the authorized period of OPT. Such reporting must be made within five business days of the termination or departure. An employer shall consider a student to have departed when the employer knows the student has left the practical training opportunity, or if the student has not reported for his or her practical training for a period of five consecutive business days without the consent of the employer, whichever occurs earlier.
(7) Training Plan for STEM OPT Students, Form I-983 or successor form. (i) A student must fully complete an individualized Form I-983 or successor form and obtain requisite signatures from an appropriate individual in the employer's organization on the form, consistent with form instructions, before the DSO may recommend a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section in SEVIS. A student must submit the Form I-983 or successor form, which includes a certification of adherence to the training plan completed by an appropriate individual in the employer's organization who has signatory authority for the employer, to the student's DSO, prior to the new DSO recommendation. A student must present his or her signed and completed Form I-983 or successor form to a DSO at the educational institution of his or her most recent enrollment. A student, while in F-1 student status, may also be required to submit the Form I-983 or successor form to ICE and/or USCIS upon request or in accordance with form instructions.
(ii) The training plan described in the Form I-983 or successor form must identify goals for the STEM practical training opportunity, including specific knowledge, skills, or techniques that will be imparted to the student, and explain how those goals will be achieved through the work-based learning opportunity with the employer; describe a performance evaluation process; and describe methods of oversight and supervision. Employers may rely on their otherwise existing training programs or policies to satisfy the requirements relating to performance evaluation and oversight and supervision, as applicable.
(iii) The training plan described in the Form I-983 or successor form must explain how the training is directly related to the student's qualifying STEM degree.
(iv) If a student initiates a new practical training opportunity with a new employer during his or her 24-month OPT extension, the student must submit, within 10 days of beginning the new practical training opportunity, a new Form I-983 or successor form to the student's DSO, and subsequently obtain a new DSO recommendation.
(8) Duties, hours, and compensation for training. The terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity during the period of the 24-month OPT extension, including duties, hours, and compensation, must be commensurate with terms and conditions applicable to the employer's similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment. A student may not engage in practical training for less than 20 hours per week, excluding time off taken consistent with leave-related policies applicable to the employer's similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment. If the employer does not employ and has not recently employed more than two similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment, the employer nevertheless remains obligated to attest that the terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity are commensurate with the terms and conditions of employment for other similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment. “Similarly situated U.S. workers” includes U.S. workers performing similar duties subject to similar supervision and with similar educational backgrounds, industry expertise, employment experience, levels of responsibility, and skill sets as the student. The duties, hours, and compensation of such students are “commensurate” with those offered to U.S. workers employed by the employer in the same area of employment when the employer can show that the duties, hours, and compensation are consistent with the range of such terms and conditions the employer has offered or would offer to similarly situated U.S. employees. The student must disclose his or her compensation, including any adjustments, as agreed to with the employer, on the Form I-983 or successor form.
(9) Evaluation requirements and Training Plan modifications. (i) A student may not be authorized for employment with an employer pursuant to paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section unless the student submits a self-evaluation of the student's progress toward the training goals described in the Form I-983 or successor form. All required evaluations must be completed prior to the conclusion of a STEM practical training opportunity, and the student and an appropriate individual in the employer's organization must sign each evaluation to attest to its accuracy. All STEM practical training opportunities require an initial evaluation within 12 months of the approved starting date on the employment authorization document granted pursuant to the student's 24-month OPT extension application, and a concluding evaluation. The student is responsible for ensuring the DSO receives his or her 12-month evaluation and final evaluation no later than 10 days following the conclusion of the reporting period or conclusion of his or her practical training opportunity, respectively.
(ii) If any material change to or deviation from the training plan described in the Form I-983 or successor form occurs, the student and employer must sign a modified Form I-983 or successor form reflecting the material change(s) or deviation(s). Material changes and deviations relating to training may include, but are not limited to, any change of Employer Identification Number resulting from a corporate restructuring, any reduction in compensation from the amount previously submitted on the Form I-983 or successor form that is not tied to a reduction in hours worked, any significant decrease in hours per week that a student engages in a STEM training opportunity, and any decrease in hours worked below the minimum hours for the 24-month extension as described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(8) of this section. Material changes and deviations also include any change or deviation that renders an employer attestation inaccurate, or renders inaccurate the information in the Form I-983 or successor form on the nature, purpose, oversight, or assessment of the student's practical training opportunity. The student and employer must ensure that the modified Form I-983 or successor form is submitted to the student's DSO at the earliest available opportunity.
(iii) The educational institution whose DSO is responsible for duties associated with the student's latest OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section is responsible for ensuring the Student and Exchange Visitor Program has access to each individualized Form I-983 or successor form and associated student evaluations (electronic or hard copy), including through SEVIS if technologically available, beginning within 30 days after the document is submitted to the DSO and continuing for a period of three years following the completion of each STEM practical training opportunity.
(10) Additional STEM opportunity obligations. A student may only participate in a STEM practical training opportunity in which the employer attests, including by signing the Form I-983 or successor form, that:
(i) The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available and is prepared to provide appropriate training in connection with the specified opportunity at the location(s) specified in the Form I-983 or successor form;
(ii) The student on a STEM OPT extension will not replace a full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. worker; and
(iii) The student's opportunity assists the student in reaching his or her training goals.
(11) Site visits. DHS, at its discretion, may conduct a site visit of any employer. The purpose of the site visit is for DHS to ensure that each employer possesses and maintains the ability and resources to provide structured and guided work-based learning experiences consistent with any Form I-983 or successor form completed and signed by the employer. DHS will provide notice to the employer 48 hours in advance of any site visit, except notice may not be provided if the visit is triggered by a complaint or other evidence of noncompliance with the regulations in this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C).
(D) Duration of status while on post-completion OPT. For a student with approved post-completion OPT, the duration of status is defined as the period beginning on the date that the student's application for OPT was properly filed and pending approval, including the authorized period of post-completion OPT, and ending 60 days after the OPT employment authorization expires.
(E) Periods of unemployment during post-completion OPT. During post-completion OPT, F-1 status is dependent upon employment. Students may not accrue an aggregate of more than 90 days of unemployment during any post-completion OPT period described in 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). Students granted a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section may not accrue an aggregate of more than 150 days of unemployment during a total OPT period, including any post-completion OPT period described in 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B) and any subsequent 24-month extension period.
(11) OPT application and approval process—(i) Student responsibilities. A student must initiate the OPT application process by requesting a recommendation for OPT from his or her DSO. Upon making the recommendation, the DSO will provide the student a signed Form I-20 indicating that recommendation.
(A) Applications for employment authorization. The student must properly file an Application for Employment Authorization, Form I-765 or successor form, with USCIS, accompanied by the required fee, and the supporting documents, as described in the form's instructions.
(B) Applications and filing deadlines for pre-completion OPT and post-completion OPT—(1) Pre-completion OPT. For pre-completion OPT, the student may properly file his or her Form I-765 or successor form up to 90 days before being enrolled for one full academic year, provided that the period of employment will not start prior to the completion of the full academic year.
(2) Post-completion OPT. For post-completion OPT, not including a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section, the student may properly file his or her Form I-765 or successor form up to 90 days prior to his or her program end date and no later than 60 days after his or her program end date. The student must also file his or her Form I-765 or successor form with USCIS within 30 days of the date the DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into his or her SEVIS record.
(C) Applications and filing deadlines for 24-month OPT extension. A student meeting the eligibility requirements for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section may request an extension of employment authorization by filing Form I-765 or successor form, with the required fee and supporting documents, up to 90 days prior to the expiration date of the student's current OPT employment authorization. The student seeking such 24-month OPT extension must properly file his or her Form I-765 or successor form with USCIS within 60 days of the date the DSO enters the recommendation for the OPT extension into his or her SEVIS record. If a student timely and properly files an application for such 24-month OPT extension and timely and properly requests a DSO recommendation, including by submitting the fully executed Form I-983 or successor form to his or her DSO, but the Employment Authorization Document, Form I-766 or successor form, currently in the student's possession expires prior to the decision on the student's application for the OPT extension, the student's Form I-766 or successor form is extended automatically pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(6)(iv).
(D) Start of OPT employment. A student may not begin OPT employment prior to the approved start date on his or her Employment Authorization Document, Form I-766 or successor form, except as described in paragraph (f)(11)(i)(C) of this section. A student may not request a start date that is more than 60 days after the student's program end date. Employment authorization will begin on the date requested or the date the employment authorization is adjudicated, whichever is later.
(ii) Additional DSO responsibilities. A student must have a recommendation from his or her DSO in order to apply for OPT. When a DSO recommends a student for OPT, the school assumes the added responsibility for maintaining the SEVIS record of that student for the entire period of authorized OPT, consistent with paragraph (f)(12) of this section.
(A) Prior to making a recommendation, the DSO at the educational institution of the student's most recent enrollment must ensure that the student is eligible for the given type and period of OPT and that the student is aware of the student's responsibilities for maintaining status while on OPT. Prior to recommending a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section, the DSO at the educational institution of the student's most recent enrollment must certify that the student's degree being used to qualify that student for the 24-month OPT extension, as shown in SEVIS or official transcripts, is a bachelor's, master's, or doctorate degree with a degree code that is contained within a category on the current STEM Designated Degree Program List at the time the recommendation is made. A DSO may recommend a student for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section only if the Form I-983 or successor form described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(7) of this section has been properly completed and executed by the student and prospective employer. A DSO may not recommend a student for an OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section if the practical training would be conducted by an employer who has failed to meet the requirements under paragraphs (f)(10)(ii)(C)(5) through (9) of this section or has failed to provide the required assurances of paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(10) of this section.
(B) The DSO must update the student's SEVIS record with the DSO's recommendation for OPT before the student can apply to USCIS for employment authorization. The DSO will indicate in SEVIS whether the OPT employment is to be full-time or part-time, or for a student seeking a recommendation for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section whether the OPT employment meets the minimum hours requirements described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(8) of this section, and note in SEVIS the OPT start and end dates.
(C) The DSO must provide the student with a signed, dated Form I-20 or successor form indicating that OPT has been recommended.
(iii) Decision on application for OPT employment authorization. USCIS will adjudicate a student's Form I-765 or successor form on the basis of the DSO's recommendation and other eligibility considerations.
(A) If granted, the employment authorization period for post-completion OPT begins on the requested date of commencement or the date the Form I-765 or successor form is approved, whichever is later, and ends at the conclusion of the remaining time period of post-completion OPT eligibility. The employment authorization period for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section begins on the day after the expiration of the initial post-completion OPT employment authorization and ends 24 months thereafter, regardless of the date the actual extension is approved.
(B) USCIS will notify the applicant of the decision on the Form I-765 or successor form in writing, and, if the application is denied, of the reason or reasons for the denial.
(C) The applicant may not appeal the decision.
(12) Reporting while on optional practical training—(i) General. An F-1 student who is granted employment authorization by USCIS to engage in optional practical training is required to report any change of name or address, or interruption of such employment to the DSO for the duration of the optional practical training. A DSO who recommends a student for OPT is responsible for updating the student's record to reflect these reported changes for the duration of the time that training is authorized.
(ii) Additional reporting obligations for students with an approved 24-month OPT extension. Students with an approved 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section have additional reporting obligations. Compliance with these reporting requirements is required to maintain F-1 status. The reporting obligations are:
(A) Within 10 days of the change, the student must report to the student's DSO a change of legal name, residential or mailing address, employer name, employer address, and/or loss of employment.
(B) The student must complete a validation report, confirming that the information required by paragraph (f)(12)(ii)(A) of this section has not changed, every six months. The requirement for validation reporting starts on the date the 24-month OPT extension begins and ends when the student's F-1 status expires or the 24-month OPT extension concludes, whichever is first. The validation report is due to the student's DSO within 10 business days of each reporting date.
(13) Temporary absence from the United States of F-1 student granted employment authorization. (i) A student returning from a temporary trip abroad with an unexpired off-campus employment authorization on his or her I-20 ID may resume employment only if the student is readmitted to attend the same school which granted the employment authorization.
(ii) An F-1 student who has an unexpired EAD issued for post-completion practical training and who is otherwise admissible may return to the United States to resume employment after a period of temporary absence. The EAD must be used in combination with an I-20 ID endorsed for reentry by the DSO within the last six months.
(14) Effect of strike or other labor dispute. Any employment authorization, whether or not part of an academic program, is automatically suspended upon certification by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's designee to the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service or the Commissioner's designee, that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place of employment. As used in this paragraph, “place of employment” means the facility or facilities where a labor dispute exists. The employer is prohibited from transferring F-1 students working at other facilities to the facility where the work stoppage is occurring.
(15) Spouse and children of F-1 student. The F-2 spouse and minor children of an F-1 student shall each be issued an individual SEVIS Form I-20 in accordance with the provisions of §214.3(k).
(i) Employment. The F-2 spouse and children of an F-1 student may not accept employment.
(ii) Study—(A) F-2 post-secondary/vocational study—(1) Authorized study at SEVP-certified schools. An F-2 spouse or F-2 child may enroll in less than a full course of study, as defined in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) and (m)(9)(i) through (iv), in any course of study described in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) or (m)(9)(i) through (iv) of this section at an SEVP-certified school. Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(B) and (m)(9)(i) of this section, study at an undergraduate college or university or at a community college or junior college is not a full course of study solely because the F-2 nonimmigrant is engaging in a lesser course load to complete a course of study during the current term. An F-2 spouse or F-2 child enrolled in less than a full course of study is not eligible to engage in employment pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9) and (10) of this section or pursuant to paragraph (m)(14) of this section.
(2) Full course of study. Subject to paragraphs (f)(15)(ii)(B) and (f)(18) of this section, an F-2 spouse and child may engage in a full course of study only by applying for and obtaining a change of status to F-1, M-1 or J-1 nonimmigrant status, as appropriate, before beginning a full course of study. An F-2 spouse and child may engage in study that is avocational or recreational in nature, up to and including on a full-time basis.
(B) F-2 elementary or secondary study. An F-2 child may engage in full-time study, including any full course of study, in any elementary or secondary school (kindergarten through twelfth grade).
(C) An F-2 spouse and child violates his or her nonimmigrant status by enrolling in any study except as provided in paragraph (f)(15)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(16) Reinstatement to student status—(i) General. The district director may consider reinstating a student who makes a request for reinstatement on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, accompanied by a properly completed SEVIS Form I-20 indicating the DSO's recommendation for reinstatement (or a properly completed Form I-20A-B issued prior to January 30, 2003, from the school the student is attending or intends to attend prior to August 1, 2003). The district director may consider granting the request if the student:
(A) Has not been out of status for more than 5 months at the time of filing the request for reinstatement (or demonstrates that the failure to file within the 5 month period was the result of exceptional circumstances and that the student filed the request for reinstatement as promptly as possible under these exceptional circumstances);
(B) Does not have a record of repeated or willful violations of Service regulations;
(C) Is currently pursuing, or intending to pursue, a full course of study in the immediate future at the school which issued the Form I-20;
(D) Has not engaged in unauthorized employment;
(E) Is not deportable on any ground other than section 237(a)(1)(B) or (C)(i) of the Act; and
(F) Establishes to the satisfaction of the Service, by a detailed showing, either that:
(1) The violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond the student's control. Such circumstances might include serious injury or illness, closure of the institution, a natural disaster, or inadvertence, oversight, or neglect on the part of the DSO, but do not include instances where a pattern of repeated violations or where a willful failure on the part of the student resulted in the need for reinstatement; or
(2) The violation relates to a reduction in the student's course load that would have been within a DSO's power to authorize, and that failure to approve reinstatement would result in extreme hardship to the student.
(ii) Decision. If the Service reinstates the student, the Service shall endorse the student's copy of Form I-20 to indicate the student has been reinstated and return the form to the student. If the Form I-20 is from a non-SEVIS school, the school copy will be forwarded to the school. If the Form I-20 is from a SEVIS school, the adjudicating officer will update SEVIS to reflect the Service's decision. In either case, if the Service does not reinstate the student, the student may not appeal that decision.
(17) Current name and address. A student must inform the DSO and the Service of any legal changes to his or her name or of any change of address, within 10 days of the change, in a manner prescribed by the school. A student enrolled at a SEVIS school can satisfy the requirement in 8 CFR 265.1 of notifying the Service by providing a notice of a change of address within 10 days to the DSO, who in turn shall enter the information in SEVIS within 21 days of notification by the student. A student enrolled at a non-SEVIS school must submit a notice of change of address to the Service, as provided in 8 CFR 265.1, within 10 days of the change. Except in the case of a student who cannot receive mail where he or she resides, the address provided by the student must be the actual physical location where the student resides rather than a mailing address. In cases where a student provides a mailing address, the school must maintain a record of, and must provide upon request from the Service, the actual physical location where the student resides.
(18) Special rules for certain border commuter students—(i) Applicability. For purposes of the special rules in this paragraph (f)(18), the term “border commuter student” means a national of Canada or Mexico who is admitted to the United States as an F-1 nonimmigrant student to enroll in a full course of study, albeit on a part-time basis, in an approved school located within 75 miles of a United States land border. A border commuter student must maintain actual residence and place of abode in the student's country of nationality, and seek admission to the United States at a land border port-of-entry. These special rules do not apply to a national of Canada or Mexico who is:
(A) Residing in the United States while attending an approved school as an F-1 student, or
(B) Enrolled in a full course of study as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section.
(ii) Full course of study. The border commuter student must be enrolled in a full course of study at the school that leads to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective, albeit on a part-time basis. A designated school official at the school may authorize an eligible border commuter student to enroll in a course load below that otherwise required for a full course of study under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, provided that the reduced course load is consistent with the border commuter student's approved course of study.
(iii) Period of admission. An F-1 nonimmigrant student who is admitted as a border commuter student under this paragraph (f)(18) will be admitted until a date certain. The DSO is required to specify a completion date on the Form I-20 that reflects the actual semester or term dates for the commuter student's current term of study. A new Form I-20 will be required for each new semester or term that the border commuter student attends at the school. The provisions of paragraphs (f)(5) and (f)(7) of this section, relating to duration of status and extension of stay, are not applicable to a border commuter student.
(iv) Employment. A border commuter student may not be authorized to accept any employment in connection with his or her F-1 student status, except for curricular practical training as provided in paragraph (f)(10)(i) of this section or post-completion optional practical training as provided in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(A)(3) of this section.
(19) Remittance of the fee. An alien who applies for F-1 or F-3 nonimmigrant status in order to enroll in a program of study at a Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-approved educational institution is required to pay the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee to DHS, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.13, except as otherwise provided in that section.

Each exchange alien participating in a program of graduate medical education or training shall file Form I-644 (Supplementary Statement for Graduate Medical Trainees) annually with the Service attesting to the conditions as specified on the form. The exchange alien shall also submit Form I-644 as an attachment to a completed Form DS-2019 when applying for an extension of stay.
When the approval of an exchange visitor program is withdrawn by the Director of the United States Information Agency, the district director shall send a notice of the withdrawal to each participant in the program and a copy of each such notice shall be sent to the program sponsor. If the exchange visitor is currently engaged in activities authorized by the cancelled program, the participant is authorized to remain in the United States to engage in those activities until expiration of the period of stay previously authorized. The district director shall notify participants in cancelled programs that permission to remain in the United States as an exchange visitor, or extension of stay may be obtained if the participant is accepted in another approved program and a Form DS-2019, executed by the new program sponsor, is submitted. In this case, a release from the sponsor of the cancelled program will not be required.

(m) Students in established vocational or other recognized nonacademic institutions, other than in language training programs—(1) Admission of student—(i) Eligibility for admission. A nonimmigrant student may be admitted into the United States in nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(M) of the Act, if:
(A) The student presents a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in his or her own name by a school approved by the Service for attendance by M-1 foreign students. (In the alternative, for a student seeking admission prior to August 1, 2003, the student may present a currently-valid Form I-20M-N/I-20ID, if that form was issued by the school prior to January 30, 2003);
(B) The student has documentary evidence of financial support in the amount indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20M-N/I-20ID); and
(C) For students seeking initial admission only, the student intends to attend the school specified in the student's visa (or, where the student is exempt from the requirement for a visa, the school indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20M-N/I-20ID)).
(ii) Disposition of Form I-20M-N. When a student is admitted to the United States, the inspecting officer shall forward Form I-20M-N to the Service's processing center. The processing center shall forward Form I-20N to the school which issued the form to notify the school of the student's admission.
(iii) Use of SEVIS. On January 30, 2003, the use of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) will become mandatory for the issuance of any new Form I-20. A student or dependent who presents a non-SEVIS Form I-20 issued on or after January 30, 2003, will not be accepted for admission to the United States. Non-SEVIS Forms I-20 issued prior to January 30, 2003, will continue to be accepted for admission to the United States until August 1, 2003. However, schools must issue a SEVIS Form I-20 to any current student requiring a reportable action (e.g., extension of status, practical training, and requests for employment authorization) or a new Form I-20, or for any aliens who must obtain a new nonimmigrant student visa. As of August 1, 2003, the records of all current or continuing students must be entered in SEVIS.
(2) Form I-20 ID copy. The first time an M-1 student comes into contact with the Service for any reason, the student must present to the Service a Form I-20M-N properly and completely filled out by the student and by the designated official of the school the student is attending or intends to attend. The student will be issued a Form I-20 ID copy with his or her admission number. The student must have the Form I-20 ID copy with him or her at all times. If the student loses the Form I-20 ID copy, the student must request a new Form I-20 ID copy on Form I-102 from the Service office having jurisdiction over the school the student was last authorized to attend.
(3) Admission of the spouse and minor children of an M-1 student. The spouse and minor children accompanying an M-1 student are eligible for admission in M-2 status if the student is admitted in M-1 status. The spouse and minor children following-to-join an M-1 student are eligible for admission to the United States in M-2 status if they are able to demonstrate that the M-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study, or engaged in approved practical training following completion of studies. In either case, at the time they seek admission, the eligible spouse and minor children of an M-1 student with a SEVIS Form I-20 must individually present an original SEVIS Form I-20 issued in the name of each M-2 dependent issued by a school authorized by the Service for attendance by M-1 foreign students. Prior to August 1, 2003, if exigent circumstances are demonstrated, the Service will allow the dependent of an M-1 student in possession of a SEVIS Form I-20 to enter the United States using a copy of the M-1 student's SEVIS Form I-20. (In the alternative, for dependents seeking admission to the United States prior to August 1, 2003, a copy of the M-1 student's current Form I-20ID issued prior to January 30, 2003, with proper endorsement by the DSO will satisfy this requirement.) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or Form I-20M-N) is required for a dependent where there has been any substantive change in the M-1 student's current information.
(i) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued; or
(ii) A new Form I-20M-N if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued.
(4) Temporary absence—(i) General. An M-1 student returning to the United States from a temporary absence to attend the school which the student was previously authorized to attend must present either—
(A) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued; or
(B) A new Form I-20M-N if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued.
(ii) Student who transferred between schools. If an M-1 student has been authorized to transfer between schools and is returning to the United States from a temporary absence in order to attend the school to which transfer was authorized as indicated on the student's Form I-20 ID copy, the name of the school to which the student is destined does not need to be specified in the student's visa.
(5) Period of stay. A student in M nonimmigrant status is admitted for a fixed time period, which is the period necessary to complete the course of study indicated on the Form I-20, plus practical training following completion of the course of study, plus an additional 30 days to depart the United States, but not to exceed a total period of one year. An M-1 student may be admitted for a period up to 30 days before the report date or start date of the course of study listed on the Form I-20. An M-1 student who fails to maintain a full course of study or otherwise fails to maintain status is not eligible for the additional 30-day period of stay.
(6)-(8) [Reserved]
(9) Full course of study. Successful completion of the course of study must lead to the attainment of a specific educational or vocational objective. A “full course of study” as required by section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act means—
(i) Study at a community college or junior college, certified by a school official to consist of at least twelve semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter-hour systems, where all students enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or considered full-time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the district director) except when the student needs a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term;
(ii) Study at a postsecondary vocational or business school, other than in a language training program except as provided in §214.3(a)(2)(iv), which confers upon its graduates recognized associate or other degrees or has established that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning which are either: (1) A school (or school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof; or (2) a school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; and which has been certified by a designated school official to consist of at least twelve hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by the district director;
(iii) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic curriculum, other than in a language training program except as provided in §214.3(a)(2)(iv), certified by a designated school official to consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or at least twenty-two clock hours a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of shop or laboratory work; or
(iv) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic high school curriculum, certified by a designated school official to consist of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress towards graduation.
(v) On-line courses/distance education programs. No on-line or distance education classes may be considered to count toward an M-1 student's full course of study requirement if such classes do not require the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to completion of the class. An on-line or distance education course is a course that is offered principally through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing.
(vi) Reduced course load. The designated school official may authorize an M-1 student to engage in less than a full course of study only where the student has been compelled by illness or a medical condition that has been documented by a licensed medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or licensed clinical psychologist, to interrupt or reduce his or her course of study. A DSO may not authorize a reduced course load for more than an aggregate of 5 months per course of study. An M-1 student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to illness or medical condition for an aggregate of 5 months, may not be authorized by the DSO to reduce his or her course load on subsequent occasions during his or her particular course of study.
(A) Non-SEVIS schools. A DSO must report any student who has been authorized by the DSO to carry a reduced course load. Within 21 days of the authorization, the DSO must send a photocopy of the student's Form I-20 to the Service's data processing center indicating the date that authorization was granted. The DSO must also report to the Service's data processing center when the student has resumed a full course of study, no more than 21 days from the date the student resumed a full course of study. In this case, the DSO must submit a photocopy of the student's Form I-20 indicating the date that a full course of study was resumed, with a new program end date.
(B) SEVIS reporting. In order for a student to be authorized to drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS prior to the student reducing his or her course load. The DSO must update SEVIS with the date, reason for authorization, and the start date of the next term or session. The DSO must also notify SEVIS within 21 days of the student's commencement of a full course of study.

(10) Extension of stay—(i) Eligibility. The cumulative time of extensions that can be granted to an M-1 student is limited to a period of 3 years from the M-1 student's original start date, plus 30 days. No extension can be granted to an M-1 student if the M-1 student is unable to complete the course of study within 3 years of the original program start date. This limit includes extensions that have been granted due to a drop below full course of study, a transfer of schools, or reinstatement. An M-1 student may be granted an extension of stay if it is established that:
(A) He or she is a bona fide nonimmigrant currently maintaining student status;
(B) Compelling educational or medical reasons have resulted in a delay to his or her course of study. Delays caused by academic probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program extension; and
(C) He or she is able to, and in good faith intends to, continue to maintain that status for the period for which the extension is granted.
(ii) Application. A student must apply to the Service for an extension on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status. A student's M-2 spouse and children seeking an extension of stay must be included in the application. The student must submit the application to the service center having jurisdiction over the school the student is currently authorized to attend, at least 15 days but not more than 60 days before the program end date on the student's Form I-20. The application must also be accompanied by the student's Form I-20 and the Forms I-94 of the student's spouse and children, if applicable.
(iii) Period of stay. If an application for extension is granted, the student and the student's spouse and children, if applicable, are to be given an extension of stay for the period of time necessary to complete the course of study, plus 30 days within which to depart from the United States, or for a total period of one year, whichever is less. A student's M-2 spouse and children are not eligible for an extension unless the M-1 student is granted an extension of stay, or for a longer period than is granted to the M-1 student.
(iv) SEVIS update. A DSO must update SEVIS to recommend that a student be approved for an extension of stay. The SEVIS Form I-20 must be printed with the recommendation and new program end date for submission by mail to the service center, with Form I-539, and Forms I-94 if applicable.
(11) School transfer—(i) Eligibility. An M-1 student may not transfer to another school after six months from the date the student is first admitted as, or changes nonimmigrant classification to that of, an M-1 student unless the student is unable to remain at the school to which the student was initially admitted due to circumstances beyond the student's control. An M-1 student may be otherwise eligible to transfer to another school if the student—
(A) Is a bona fide nonimmigrant;
(B) Has been pursuing a full course of study at the school the student was last authorized to attend;
(C) Intends to pursue a full course of study at the school to which the student intends to transfer; and
(D) Is financially able to attend the school to which the student intends to transfer.
(ii) Procedure. A student must apply to the Service on Form I-539 for permission to transfer between schools. Upon application for school transfer, a student may effect the transfer subject to approval of the application. A student who transfers without complying with this requirement or whose application is denied after transfer pursuant to this regulation is considered to be out of status. If the application is approved, the approval of the transfer will be determined to be the program start date listed on the Form I-20, and the student will be granted an extension of stay for the period of time necessary to complete the new course of study plus 30 days, or for a total period of one year, whichever is less.
(A) Non-SEVIS school. The application must be accompanied by the Form I-20ID copy and the Form I-94 of the student's spouse and children, if applicable. The Form I-539 must also be accompanied by Form I-20M-N properly and completely filled out by the student and by the designated official of the school which the student wishes to attend. Upon approval, the adjudicating officer will endorse the name of the school to which the transfer is authorized on the student's Form I-20ID copy and return it to the student. The officer will also endorse Form I-20M-N to indicate that a school transfer has been authorized and forward it to the Service's processing center for updating. The processing center will forward Form I-20M-N to the school to which the transfer has been authorized to notify the school of the action taken.
(B) SEVIS school. The student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and indicate the school to which the student intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school must update SEVIS to show the student as a “transfer out” and input the “release date” for transfer. Once updated as a “transfer out” the transfer school is permitted to generate a SEVIS Form I-20 for transfer but will not gain access to the student's SEVIS record until the release date is reached. Upon receipt of the SEVIS Form I-20 from the transfer school, the student must submit Form I-539 in accordance with §214.2(m)(11). The student may enroll in the transfer school at the next available term or session and is required to notify the DSO of the transfer school immediately upon beginning attendance. The transfer school must update the student's registration record in SEVIS in accordance with §214.3(g)(3). Upon approval of the transfer application, the Service officer will endorse the name of the school to which the transfer is authorized on the student's SEVIS Form I-20 and return it to the student.
(C) Transition process. Once SEVIS is fully operational and interfaced with the service center benefit processing system, the Service officer will transmit the approval of the transfer to SEVIS and endorse the name of the school to which transfer is authorized on the student's SEVIS Form I-20 and return it to the student. As part of a transitional process until that time, the student is required to notify the DSO at the transfer school of the decision of the Service within 15 days of the receipt of the adjudication by the Service. Upon notification by the student of the approval of the Service, the DSO must immediately update SEVIS to show that approval of the transfer has been granted. The DSO must then print an updated SEVIS Form I-20 for the student indicating that the transfer has been completed. If the application for transfer is denied, the student is out of status and the DSO must terminate the student's record in SEVIS.
(iii) Student who has not been pursuing a full course of study. If an M-1 student who has not been pursuing a full course of study at the school the student was last authorized to attend desires to attend a different school, the student must apply for reinstatement to student status under paragraph (m)(16) of this section.
(12) Change in educational objective. An M-1 student may not change educational objective.
(13) Employment. Except as provided in paragraph (m)(14) of this section, a student may not accept employment.
(14) Practical training—(i) When practical training may be authorized. Temporary employment for practical training may be authorized only after completion of the student's course of study.
(A) The proposed employment is recommended for the purpose of practical training;
(B) The proposed employment is related to the student's course of study; and
(C) Upon the designated school official's information and belief, employment comparable to the proposed employment is not available to the student in the country of the student's foreign residence.
(ii) Application. A M-1 student must apply for permission to accept employment for practical training on Form I-765, with fee as contained in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), accompanied by a Form I-20 that has been endorsed for practical training by the designated school official. The application must be submitted prior to the program end date listed on the student's Form I-20 but not more than 90 days before the program end date. The designated school official must certify on Form I-538 that—
(A) The proposed employment is recommended for the purpose of practical training;
(B) The proposed employment is related to the student's course of study; and
(C) Upon the designated school official's information and belief, employment comparable to the proposed employment is not available to the student in the country of the student's foreign residence.
(iii) Duration of practical training. When the student is authorized to engage in employment for practical training, he or she will be issued an employment authorization document. The M-1 student may not begin employment until he or she has been issued an employment authorization document by the Service. One month of employment authorization will be granted for each four months of full-time study that the M-1 student has completed. However, an M-1 student may not engage in more than six months of practical training in the aggregate. The student will not be granted employment authorization if he or she cannot complete the requested practical training within six months.
(iv) Temporary absence of M-1 student granted practical training. An M-1 student who has been granted permission to accept employment for practical training and who temporarily departs from the United States, may be readmitted for the remainder of the authorized period indicated on the student's Form I-20 ID copy. The student must be returning to the United States to perform the authorized practical training. A student may not be readmitted to begin practical training which was not authorized prior to the student's departure from the United States.
(v) Effect of strike or other labor dispute. Authorization for all employment for practical training is automatically suspended upon certification by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's designee to the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization or the Commissioner's designee that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place of employment. As used in this paragraph, “place of employment” means wherever the employer or joint employer does business.
(vi) SEVIS process. The DSO must update the student's record in SEVIS to recommend that the Service approve the student for practical training, and print SEVIS Form I-20 with the recommendation, for the student to submit to the Service with Form I-765 as provided in this paragraph (m)(14).
(15) Decision on application for extension, permission to transfer to another school, or permission to accept employment for practical training. The Service shall notify the applicant of the decision and, if the application is denied, of the reason(s) for the denial. The applicant may not appeal the decision.
(16) Reinstatement to student status—(i) General. A district director may consider reinstating a student who makes a request for reinstatement on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, accompanied by a properly completed SEVIS Form I-20 indicating the DSO's recommendation for reinstatement (or a properly completed Form I-20M-N issued prior to January 30, 2003, from the school the student is attending or intends to attend prior to August 1, 2003). The district director may consider granting the request only if the student:
(A) Has not been out of status for more than 5 months at the time of filing the request for reinstatement (or demonstrates that the failure to file within the 5 month period was the result of exceptional circumstances and that the student filed the request for reinstatement as promptly as possible under these exceptional circumstances);
(B) Does not have a record of repeated or willful violations of the Service regulations;
(C) Is currently pursuing, or intends to pursue, a full course of study at the school which issued the Form I-20M-N or SEVIS Form I-20;
(D) Has not engaged in unlawful employment;
(E) Is not deportable on any ground other than section 237(a)(1)(B) or (C)(i) of the Act; and
(F) Establishes to the satisfaction of the Service, by a detailed showing, either that:
(1) The violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond the student's control. Such circumstances might include serious injury or illness, closure of the institution, a natural disaster, or inadvertence, oversight or neglect on the part of the DSO, but do not include instances where a pattern of repeated violations or where a willful failure on the part of the student resulted in the need for reinstatement; or
(2) The violation relates to a reduction in the student's course load that would have been within a DSO's power to authorize, and that failure to approve reinstatement would result in extreme hardship to the student.
(ii) Decision. If the Service reinstates the student, the Service shall endorse the student's copy of Form I-20 to indicate that the student has been reinstated and return the form to the student. If the Form I-20 is from a non-SEVIS school, the school copy will be forwarded to the school. If the Form I-20 is from a SEVIS school, the adjudicating officer will update SEVIS to reflect the Service's decision. In either case, if the Service does not reinstate the student, the student may not appeal the decision. The district director will send notification to the school of the decision.
(17) Spouse and children of M-1 student. The M-2 spouse and minor children of an M-1 student shall each be issued an individual SEVIS Form I-20 in accordance with the provisions of §214.3(k).
(i) Employment. The M-2 spouse and children may not accept employment.
(ii) Study—(A) M-2 post-secondary/vocational study—(1) Authorized study at SEVP-certified schools. An M-2 spouse or M-2 child may enroll in less than a full course of study, as defined in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) or (m)(9)(i) through (v), in any course of study described in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) or (m)(9)(i) through (v) of this section at an SEVP-certified school. Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(B) and (m)(9)(i) of this section, study at an undergraduate college or university or at a community college or junior college is not a full course of study solely because the M-2 nonimmigrant is engaging in a lesser course load to complete a course of study during the current term. An M-2 spouse or M-2 child enrolled in less than a full course of study is not eligible to engage in employment pursuant to paragraph (m)(14) of this section or pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9) through (10) of this section.
(2) Full course of study. Subject to paragraph (m)(17)(ii)(B) of this section, an M-2 spouse and child may engage in a full course of study only by applying for and obtaining a change of status to F-1, M-1, or J-1 status, as appropriate, before beginning a full course of study. An M-2 spouse and M-2 child may engage in study that is avocational or recreational in nature, up to and including on a full-time basis.
(B) M-2 elementary or secondary study. An M-2 child may engage in full-time study, including any full course of study, in any elementary or secondary school (kindergarten through twelfth grade).
(C) An M-2 spouse or child violates his or her nonimmigrant status by enrolling in any study except as provided in paragraph (m)(17)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(18) Current name and address. A student must inform the Service and the DSO of any legal changes to his or her name or of any change of address, within 10 days of the change, in a manner prescribed by the school. A student enrolled at a SEVIS school can satisfy the requirement in 8 CFR 265.1 of notifying the Service by providing a notice of a change of address within 10 days to the DSO, and the DSO in turn shall enter the information in SEVIS within 21 days of notification by the student. A nonimmigrant student enrolled at a non-SEVIS institution must submit a notice of change of address to the Service, as provided in 8 CFR 265.1, within 10 days of the change. Except in the case of a student who cannot receive mail where he or she resides, the address provided by the student must be the actual physical location where the student resides rather than a mailing address. In cases where a student provides a mailing address, the school must maintain a record of, and must provide upon request from the Service, the actual physical location where the student resides.
(19) Special rules for certain border commuter students—(i) Applicability. For purposes of the special rules in this paragraph (m)(19), the term “border commuter student” means a national of Canada or Mexico who is admitted to the United States as an M-1 student to enroll in a full course of study, albeit on a part-time basis, in an approved school located within 75 miles of a United States land border. The border commuter student must maintain actual residence and place of abode in the student's country of nationality, and seek admission to the United States at a land border port-of-entry. These special rules do not apply to a national of Canada or Mexico who is:
(A) Residing in the United States while attending an approved school as an M-1 student, or
(B) Enrolled in a full course of study as defined in paragraph (m)(9) of this section.
(ii) Full course of study. The border commuter student must be enrolled in a full course of study at the school that leads to the attainment of a specific educational or vocational objective, albeit on a part-time basis. A designated school official at the school may authorize an eligible border commuter student to enroll in a course load below that otherwise required for a full course of study under paragraph (m)(9) of this section, provided that the reduced course load is consistent with the border commuter student's approved course of study.
(iii) Period of stay. An M-1 border commuter student is not entitled to an additional 30-day period of stay otherwise available under paragraph (m)(5) of this section.
(iv) Employment. A border commuter student may not be authorized to accept any employment in connection with his or her M-1 student status, except for practical training as provided in paragraph (m)(14) of this section.
(20) Remittance of the fee. An alien who applies for M-1 or M-3 nonimmigrant status in order to enroll in a program of study at a DHS-approved vocational educational institution is required to pay the SEVIS fee to DHS, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.13, except as otherwise provided in that section.

(a) Filing petition—
(1) General. A school or school system seeking initial or continued authorization for attendance by nonimmigrant students under sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act, or both, must file a petition for certification or recertification with SEVP, using the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), in accordance with the procedures at paragraph (h) of this section. The petition must state whether the school or school system is seeking certification or recertification for attendance of nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act or both. The petition must identify by name and address each location of the school that is included in the petition for certification or recertification, specifically including any physical location in which a nonimmigrant can attend classes through the school (i.e., campus, extension campuses, satellite campuses, etc.).
(i) School systems. A school system, as used in this section, means public school (grades 9-12) or private school (grades kindergarten-12). A petition by a school system must include a list of the names and addresses of those schools included in the petition with the supporting documents.
(ii) Submission requirements. Certification and recertification petitions require that a complete Form I-17, Petition for Approval of School for Attendance by Nonimmigrant Student, including supplements A and B and bearing original signatures, be included with the school's submission of supporting documentation. In submitting the Form I-17, a school certifies that the designated school officials (DSOs) signing the form have read and understand DHS regulations relating to: Nonimmigrant students at 8 CFR 214.1, 214.2(f), and/or 214.2(m); change of nonimmigrant classification for students at 8 CFR 248; school certification and recertification under this section; withdrawal of school certification under this section and 8 CFR 214.4; that both the school and its DSOs intend to comply with these regulations at all times; and that, to the best of its knowledge, the school is eligible for SEVP certification. Willful misstatements may constitute perjury (18 U.S.C. 1621).
(2) Approval for F-1 or M-1 classification, or both—(i) F-1 classification. The following schools may be approved for attendance by nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act:
(A) A college or university, i.e., an institution of higher learning which awards recognized bachelor's, master's doctor's or professional degrees.
(B) A community college or junior college which provides instruction in the liberal arts or in the professions and which awards recognized associate degrees.
(C) A seminary.
(D) A conservatory.
(E) An academic high school.
(F) A private elementary school.
(G) An institution which provides language training, instruction in the liberal arts or fine arts, instruction in the professions, or instruction or training in more than one of these disciplines.
(ii) M-1 classification. The following schools are considered to be vocational or nonacademic institutions and may be approved for attendance by nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act:
(A) A community college or junior college which provides vocational or technical training and which awards recognized associate degrees.
(B) A vocational high school.
(C) A school which provides vocational or nonacademic training other than language training.
(iii) Both F-1 and M-1 classification. A school may be approved for attendance by nonimmigrant students under both sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) and 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act if it has both instruction in the liberal arts, fine arts, language, religion, or the professions and vocational or technical training. In that case, a student whose primary intent is to pursue studies in liberal arts, fine arts, language, religion, or the professions at the school is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act. A student whose primary intent is to pursue vocational or technical training at the school is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act.
(iv) English language training for a vocational student. A student whose primary intent is to pursue vocational or technical training who takes English language training at the same school solely for the purpose of being able to understand the vocational or technical course of study is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act.
(v) The following may not be approved for attendance by foreign students:
(A) A home school,
(B) A public elementary school, or
(C) An adult education program, as defined by section 203(l) of the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, Public Law 105-220, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 9202(l), if the adult education program is funded in whole or in part by a grant under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, or by any other Federal, State, county or municipal funding.

(A) Remains eligible for certification in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section;
(B) Has complied during its previous period of certification or recertification with recordkeeping, retention, and reporting requirements and all other requirements of paragraphs (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section.
(b) Supporting documents. Institutions petitioning for certification or recertification must submit certain supporting documents as follows, pursuant to sections 101(a)(15)(F) and (M) of the Act. A petitioning school or school system owned and operated as a public educational institution or system by the United States or a State or a political subdivision thereof shall submit a certification to that effect signed by the appropriate public official who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so. A petitioning private or parochial elementary or secondary school system shall submit a certification signed by the appropriate public official who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so to the effect that it meets the requirements of the State or local public educational system. Any other petitioning school shall submit a certification by the appropriate licensing, approving, or accrediting official who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so to the effect that it is licensed, approved, or accredited. In lieu of such certification a school which offers courses recognized by a State-approving agency as appropriate for study for veterans under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3675 and 3676 may submit a statement of recognition signed by the appropriate official of the State approving agency who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so. A charter shall not be considered a license, approval, or accreditation. A school catalogue, if one is issued, shall also be submitted with each petition. If not included in the catalogue, or if a catalogue is not issued, the school shall furnish a written statement containing information concerning the size of its physical plant, nature of its facilities for study and training, educational, vocational or professional qualifications of the teaching staff, salaries of the teachers, attendance and scholastic grading policy, amount and character of supervisory and consultative services available to students and trainees, and finances (including a certified copy of the accountant's last statement of school's net worth, income, and expenses). Neither a catalogue nor such a written statement need be included with a petition submitted by:
(1) A school or school system owned and operated as a public educational institution or system by the United States or a State or a political subdivision thereof;
(2) A school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; or
(3) A secondary school operated by or as part of a school so accredited.
(c) Other evidence. If the petitioner is a vocational, business, or language school, or American institution of research recognized as such by the Secretary of Homeland Security, it must submit evidence that its courses of study are accepted as fulfilling the requirements for the attainment of an educational, professional, or vocational objective, and are not avocational or recreational in character. If the petitioner is a vocational, business, or language school, or American institution of research recognized as such by the Attorney General, it must submit evidence that its courses of study are accepted as fulfilling the requirements for the attainment of an educational, professional, or vocational objective, and are not avocational or recreational in character. If the petitioner is an institution of higher education and is not within the category described in paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section, it must submit evidence that it confers upon its graduates recognized bachelor, master, doctor, professional, or divinity degrees, or if it does not confer such degrees that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three such institutions of higher learning. If the petitioner is an elementary or secondary school and is not within the category described in paragraph (b) (1) or (3) of this section, it must submit evidence that attendance at the petitioning institution satisfies the compulsory attendance requirements of the State in which it is located and that the petitioning school qualifies graduates for acceptance by schools of a higher educational level within the category described in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section.
(d) Interview of petitioner. The petitioner or an authorized representative of the petitioner may be required to appear in person before or be interviewed by telephone by a DHS representative prior to the adjudication of a petition for certification or recertification. The interview will be conducted under oath.
(e) Notices to schools related to certification or recertification petitions or to out-of-cycle review—(1) General. All notices from SEVP to schools or school systems related to school certification, recertification, or out-of-cycle review (including, but not limited to, notices related to the collection of evidence, testimony, and appearance pertaining to petitions for recertification encompassing compliance with the recordkeeping, retention and reporting, and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section, as well as to eligibility) will be served in accordance with the procedures at 8 CFR 103.2(b)(1), (4)-(16), (18) and (19), with the exception that all procedures will be conducted by SEVP, the SEVP Director, and the Assistant Secretary, ICE, as appropriate, and except as provided in this section. All such notices will be served (i.e., generated and transmitted) through SEVIS and/or by e-mail. The date of service is the date of transmission of the e-mail notice. DSOs must maintain current contact information, including current e-mail addresses, at all times. Failure of a school to receive SEVP notices due to inaccurate DSO e-mail addresses in SEVIS or blockages of the school's e-mail system caused by spam filters is not grounds for appeal of a denial or withdrawal. The term “in writing” means either a paper copy bearing original signatures or an electronic copy bearing electronic signatures.
(2) SEVP approval notification and SEVIS updating by certified schools. SEVP will notify the petitioner by updating SEVIS to reflect approval of the petition and by e-mail upon approval of a certification or recertification petition. The certification or recertification is valid only for the type of program and nonimmigrant classification specified in the certification or recertification approval notice. The certification must be recertified every two years and may be subject to out-of-cycle review at any time. Approval may be withdrawn in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4.
(3) Modifications to Form I-17 while a school is SEVP-certified. Any modification made by an SEVP-certified school on the Form I-17 at any time after certification and for the duration of a school's authorization to enroll F and/or M students must be reported to SEVP and will be processed by SEVP in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (f)(1), (g)(2) and (h)(3)(i) of this section.
(4) Notice of Intent to Withdraw (NOIW) SEVP certification—(i) Automatic withdrawal. SEVP will serve the school with an NOIW 30 days prior to a school's SEVP certification expiration date if the school has not submitted to SEVP a completed recertification petition, in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The school will be automatically withdrawn immediately, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(a)(3), if it has not submitted a completed recertification petition by the school's certification expiration date.
(ii) Withdrawal on notice. SEVP will serve a Withdrawal on Notice, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(b), if SEVP determines that a school reviewed out-of-cycle has failed to sustain eligibility or has failed to comply with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section. When a school fails to file an answer to an NOIW within the 30-day period, SEVP will withdraw the school's certification and notify the DSOs of the decision, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(d). Such withdrawal of certification may not be appealed.
(5) Notice of Denial. A Notice of Denial will be served to a school when SEVP denies a petition for initial certification or recertification. The notice will address appeals options. Schools denied recertification must comply with 8 CFR 214.4(i).
(6) Notice of Automatic Withdrawal. Schools that relinquish SEVP certification for any of the reasons cited in 8 CFR 214.4(a)(3) will be served a Notice of Automatic Withdrawal.
(7) Notice of Withdrawal. A school found to be ineligible for continued SEVP certification as a result of an out-of-cycle review will receive a Notice of Withdrawal. Schools withdrawn must comply with 8 CFR 214.4(i).
(8) Notice of SEVIS Access Termination Date. The Notice of SEVIS Access Termination Date gives the official date for the school's denial or withdrawal to be final and SEVIS access to be terminated. In most situations, SEVP will not determine a SEVIS access termination date for that school until the appeals process has concluded and the initial denial or withdrawal has been upheld, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(i)(3). The school will no longer be able to access SEVIS and SEVP will automatically terminate any remaining Active SEVIS records for that school on that date.
(f) Adjudication of a petition for SEVP certification or recertification — (1) Approval. The school is required to immediately report through SEVIS any change to its school information upon approval of a petition for SEVP certification or recertification. Modification to school information listed in paragraph (h)(3) of this section will require a determination of continued eligibility for certification. The certification or recertification is valid only for the type of program and student specified in the approval notice. The certification may be withdrawn in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.4, is subject to review at any time, and will be reviewed every two years.
(2) Denial. The petitioner will be notified of the reasons for the denial and appeal rights, in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR part 103 and 8 CFR 214.4, if SEVP denies a petition for certification or recertification.

(g) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements — (1) Student records. An SEVP-certified school must keep records containing certain specific information and documents relating to each F-1 or M-1 student to whom it has issued a Form I-20, while the student is attending the school and until the school notifies SEVP, in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, that the student is not pursuing a full course of study. Student information not required for entry in SEVIS may be kept in the school's student system of records, but must be accessible to DSOs. The school must keep a record of having complied with the reporting requirements for at least three years after the student is no longer pursuing a full course of study. The school must maintain records on the student in accordance with paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section if a school recommends reinstatement for a student who is out of status. The school must maintain records on the student for three years from the date of the denial if the reinstatement is denied. The DSO must make the information and documents required by this paragraph available, including academic transcripts, and must furnish them to DHS representatives upon request. Schools must maintain and be able to provide an academic transcript or other routinely maintained student records that reflect the total, unabridged academic history of the student at the institution, in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section. All courses must be recorded in the academic period in which the course was taken and graded. The information and documents that the school must keep on each student are as follows:
(i) Identification of the school, to include name and full address.
(ii) Identification of the student, to include name while in attendance (record any legal name change), date and place of birth, country of citizenship, and school's student identification number.
(iii) Current address where the student and his or her dependents physically reside. In the event the student or his or her dependents cannot receive mail at such physical residence, the school must provide a mailing address in SEVIS. If the mailing address and the physical address are not the same, the school must maintain a record of both mailing and physical addresses and provide the physical location of residence of the student and his or her dependents to DHS upon request.
(iv) Record of coursework. Identify the student's degree program and field of study. For each course, give the periods of enrollment, course identification code and course title; the number of credits or contact hours, and the grade; the number of credits or clock hours, and for credit hour courses the credit unit; the term unit (semester hour, quarter hour, etc.). Include the date of withdrawal if the student withdrew from a course. Show the grade point average for each session or term. Show the cumulative credits or clock hours and cumulative grade point average. Narrative evaluation will be accepted in lieu of grades when the school uses no other type of grading.
(v) Record of transfer credit or clock hours accepted. Type of hours, course identification, grades.
(vi) Academic status. Include the effective date or period if suspended, dismissed, placed on probation, or withdrawn.
(vii) Whether the student has been certified for practical training, and the beginning and end dates of certification.
(viii) Statement of graduation (if applicable). Title of degree or credential received, date conferred, program of study or major.
(ix) Termination date and reason.
(x) The documents referred to in paragraph (k) of this section.
Note to paragraph (g)(1): A DHS officer may request any or all of the data in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (x) of this section on any individual student or class of students upon notice. This notice will be in writing if requested by the school. The school will have three work days to respond to any request for information concerning an individual student, and ten work days to respond to any request for information concerning a class of students. The school will respond orally on the same day the request for information is made if DHS requests information on a student who is being held in custody, and DHS will provide a written notification that the request was made after the fact, if the school so desires. DHS will first attempt to gain information concerning a class of students from DHS record systems.
(2) Reporting changes in student and school information. (i) Schools must update SEVIS with the current information within 21 days of a change in any of the information contained in paragraphs (f)(1) and (h)(3) of this section.
(ii) Schools are also required to report within 21 days any change of the information contained in paragraph (g)(1) or the occurrence of the following events:
(A) Any student who has failed to maintain status or complete his or her program;
(B) A change of the student's or dependent's legal name or U.S. address;
(C) Any student who has graduated early or prior to the program end date listed on SEVIS Form I-20;
(D) Any disciplinary action taken by the school against the student as a result of the student being convicted of a crime; and
(E) Any other notification request not covered by paragraph (g)(1) of this section made by DHS with respect to the current status of the student.
(F) For F-1 students authorized by USCIS to engage in a 17-month extension of OPT,
(1) Any change that the student reports to the school concerning legal name, residential or mailing address, employer name, or employer address; and
(2) The end date of the student's employment reported by a former employer in accordance with §214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(4).
(iii) Each term or session and no later than 30 days after the deadline for registering for classes, schools are required to report the following registration information:
(A) Whether the student has enrolled at the school, dropped below a full course of study without prior authorization by the DSO, or failed to enroll;
(B) The current address of each enrolled student; and
(C) The start date of the student's next session, term, semester, trimester, or quarter. For initial students, the start date is the “program start date” or “report date.” (These terms are used interchangeably.) The DSO may choose a reasonable date to accommodate a student's need to be in attendance for required activities at the school prior to the actual start of classes when determining the report date on the Form I-20. Such required activities may include, but are not limited to, research projects and orientation sessions. The DSO may not, however, indicate a report date more than 30 days prior to the start of classes. The next session start date is the start of classes for continuing students.
(D) Adjustment to the program completion date. Any factors that influence the student's progress toward program completion (e.g., deferred attendance, authorized drop below, program extension) must be reflected by making an adjustment updating the program completion date.
(3) Administrative correction of a student's record. In instances where technological or computer problems on the part of SEVIS cause an error in the student's record, the DSO may request the SEVIS system administrator, without fee, to administratively correct the student's record.
(h) SEVP certification, recertification, out-of-cycle review, and oversight of schools—(1) Certification. A school seeking SEVP certification for attendance by nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(m)(i) of the Act must use SEVIS to file an electronic petition (which compiles the data for the Form I-17) and must submit the nonrefundable certification petition fee on-line.
(i) Filing a petition. The school must access the SEVP Web site at http://www.ice.gov/sevis to file a certification petition in SEVIS. The school will be issued a temporary ID and password in order to access SEVIS to complete and submit an electronic Form I-17. The school must submit the proper nonrefundable certification petition fee as provided in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1).
(ii) Site visit, petition adjudication and school notification. SEVP will conduct a site visit for each petitioning school and its additional schools or campuses. SEVP will contact the school to arrange the site visit. The school must comply with and complete the visit within 30 days after the date SEVP contacts the school to arrange the visit, or the petition for certification will be denied as abandoned. DSOs and school officials that have signed the school's Form I-17 petition must be able to demonstrate to DHS representatives how they obtain access to the regulations cited in the certification as part of the site visit. Paper or electronic access is acceptable. DSOs must be able to extract pertinent citations within the regulations related to their requirements and responsibilities. SEVP will serve a notice of approval and SEVIS will be updated to reflect the school's certification if SEVP approves the school's certification petition.
(iii) Certification denial. SEVP will serve a notice of denial in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section if a school's petition for certification is denied.
(2) Recertification. Schools are required to file a completed petition for SEVP recertification before the school's certification expiration date, which is two years from the date of their previous SEVP certification or recertification expiration date, except for the first recertification cycle after publication of the recertification rule. There is no recertification petition fee. SEVP will review a petitioning school's compliance with the recordkeeping, retention and reporting, and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section, as well as continued eligibility for certification, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(i) Filing of petition for recertification. Schools must submit a completed Form I-17 (including supplements A and B) using SEVIS, and submit a paper copy of the Form I-17 bearing original signatures of all officials. SEVP will notify all DSOs of a previously certified school 180 days prior to the school's certification expiration date that the school may submit a petition for recertification. A school may file its recertification petition at any time after receipt of this notification. A school must submit a complete recertification petition package, as outlined in the submission guidelines, by its certification expiration date. SEVP will send a notice of confirmation of complete filing or rejection to the school upon receipt of any filing of a petition for recertification.
(A) Notice of confirmation assures a school of uninterrupted access to SEVIS while SEVP adjudicates the school's petition for recertification. A school that has complied with the petition submission requirements will continue to have SEVIS access after its certification expiration date while the adjudication for recertification is pending. The school is required to comply with all regulatory recordkeeping, retention and reporting, and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section during the period the petition is pending.
(B) Notice of rejection informs a school that it must take prompt corrective action in regard to its recertification petition prior to its certification expiration date to ensure that its SEVIS access will not be terminated and its petition for recertification will be accepted for adjudication.
(ii) Consequence of failure to petition. SEVP will serve an NOIW to the school 30 days prior to a school's certification expiration date. SEVP will no longer accept a petition for recertification from the school and will immediately withdraw the school's certification if the school does not petition for recertification, abandons its petition, or does not submit a complete recertification petition package by the certification expiration date, in accordance with the automatic withdrawal criteria in 8 CFR 214.4(a)(3). The school must comply with 8 CFR 214.4(i) upon withdrawal.
(iii) School recertification process—(A) General. School recertification reaffirms the petitioning school's eligibility for SEVP certification and the school's compliance with recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section since its previous certification.
(B) Compliance. Assessment by SEVP of a school petitioning for recertification will focus primarily on overall school compliance, but may also include examination of individual DSO compliance as data and circumstances warrant. Past performance of these individuals, whether or not they continue to serve as principal designated school officials (PDSOs) or DSOs, will be considered in any petition for recertification of the school.
(C) On-site review for recertification. All schools are subject to on-site review, at the discretion of SEVP, in conjunction with recertification. The school must comply with and complete an on-site review within 30 days of the notification by a DHS representative of a school that it has been selected for an on-site review for recertification, or the petition for recertification will be denied as abandoned, resulting in the school's withdrawal from SEVIS.
(iv) Recertification approval. SEVP will serve a notice of approval if a school's petition for recertification is approved. The date of the subsequent recertification review will be two years after the school's certification expiration date from this petition cycle.
(v) Recertification denial. SEVP will serve a notice of denial if a school's petition for recertification is denied, in accordance with 8 CFR 103.3(a)(1)(i).
(vi) Adjustment of certification expiration date. Schools eligible for recertification before March 25, 2009 will, at a minimum, have their certification expiration date extended to March 25, 2009. SEVP may extend the certification expiration date beyond this date during the first cycle of recertification.
(3) Out-of-cycle review and oversight of SEVP-certified schools. (i) SEVP will determine if out-of-cycle review is required upon receipt in SEVIS of any changes from an SEVP-certified school to its Form I-17 information. The Form I-17 information that requires out-of-cycle review when changed includes:
(A) Approval for attendance of students (F/M/both);
(B) Name of school system; name of main campus;
(C) Mailing address of the school;
(D) Location of the school;
(E) School type;
(F) Public/private school indicator;
(G) Private school owner name;
(H) The school is engaged in;
(I) The school operates under the following Federal, State, Local or other authorization;
(J) The school has been approved by the following national, regional, or state accrediting association or agency;
(K) Areas of study;
(L) Degrees available from the school;
(M) If the school is engaged in elementary or secondary education;
(N) If the school is engaged in higher education;
(O) If the school is engaged in vocational or technical education;
(P) If the school is engaged in English language training;
(Q) Adding or deleting campuses;
(R) Campus name;
(S) Campus mailing address; and
(T) Campus location address.
(ii) SEVP may request a school to electronically update all Form I-17 fields in SEVIS and provide SEVP with documentation supporting the update. The school must complete such updates in SEVIS and submit the supporting documentation to SEVP within 10 business days of the request from SEVP.
(iii) SEVP may review a school's certification at any time to verify the school's compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section to verify the school's continued eligibility for SEVP certification pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section. SEVP may initiate remedial action with the school, as appropriate, and may initiate withdrawal proceedings against the school pursuant to 8 CFR 214.4(b) if noncompliance or ineligibility of a school is identified.
(iv) On-site review. SEVP-certified schools are subject to on-site review at any time. SEVP will initiate withdrawal proceedings against a certified school, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.4(b), if the certified school selected for on-site review prior to its certification expiration date fails to comply with and complete the review within 30 days of the date SEVP contacted the school to arrange the review.
(v) Notice of Continued Eligibility. SEVP will serve the school a notice of continued eligibility if, upon completion of an out-of-cycle review, SEVP determines that the school remains eligible for certification. Such notice will not change the school's previously-determined certification expiration date unless specifically notified by SEVP.
(vi) Withdrawal of certification. SEVP will institute withdrawal proceedings in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(b) if, upon completion of an out-of-cycle review, SEVP determines that a school or its programs are no longer eligible for certification.
(vii) Voluntary withdrawal. A school can voluntarily withdraw from SEVP certification at any time or in lieu of complying with an out-of-cycle review or request. Failure of a school to comply with an out-of-cycle review or request by SEVP will be treated as a voluntary withdrawal. A school must initiate voluntary withdrawal by sending a request for withdrawal on official school letterhead to SEVP.
(i) Administration of student regulations. DHS officials may conduct out-of-cycle, on-site reviews on the campuses of SEVP-certified schools to determine whether nonimmigrant students on those campuses are complying with DHS regulations pertaining to them, including the requirement that each maintains a valid passport. DHS officers will take appropriate action regarding violations of the regulations by nonimmigrant students.

(j) Advertising. In any advertisement, catalogue, brochure, pamphlet, literature, or other material hereafter printed or reprinted by or for an approved school, any statement which may appear in such material concerning approval for attendance by nonimmigrant students shall be limited solely to the following: This school is authorized under Federal law to enroll nonimmigrant alien students.
(k) Issuance of Certificate of Eligibility. A DSO of an SEVP-certified school must sign any completed Form I-20 issued for either a prospective or continuing student or a dependent. A Form I-20 issued by a certified school system must state which school within the system the student will attend. Only a DSO of an SEVP-certified school may issue a Form I-20 to a prospective student and his or her dependents, and only after the following conditions are met:
(1) The prospective student has made a written application to the school.
(2) The written application, the student's transcripts or other records of courses taken, proof of financial responsibility for the student, and other supporting documents have been received, reviewed, and evaluated at the school's location in the United States.
(3) The appropriate school authority has determined that the prospective student's qualifications meet all standards for admission.
(4) The official responsible for admission at the school has accepted the prospective student for enrollment in a full course of study.
(l) Designated Official. (1) Meaning of term Designated Official. As used in §§214.1(b), 214.2(b), 214.2(f), 214.2(m), and 214.4, a Designated Official, Designated School Official (DSO), or Principal Designated School Official (PDSO), means a regularly employed member of the school administration whose office is located at the school and whose compensation does not come from commissions for recruitment of foreign students. An individual whose principal obligation to the school is to recruit foreign students for compensation does not qualify as a designated official. The PDSO and any other DSO must be named by the president, owner, or head of a school or school system. The PDSO and DSO may not delegate this designation to any other person.
(i) A PDSO and DSO must be either a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States.
(ii) Each campus must have one PDSO. The PDSO is responsible for updating SEVIS to reflect the addition or deletion of any DSO on his or her associated campus. SEVP will use the PDSO as the point of contact on any issues that relate to the school's compliance with the regulations, as well as any system alerts generated by SEVIS. SEVP may also designate certain functions in SEVIS for use by the PDSO only. The PDSO of the main campus is the only DSO authorized to submit a Form I-17 for recertification. The PDSO and DSO will share the same responsibilities in all other respects.
(iii) School officials may nominate as many DSOs in addition to PDSOs as they determine necessary to adequately provide recommendations to F and/or M students enrolled at the school regarding maintenance of nonimmigrant status and to support timely and complete recordkeeping and reporting to DHS, as required by this section. School officials must not permit a DSO or PDSO nominee access to SEVIS until DHS approves the nomination.
(2) Name, title, and sample signature. Petitions for SEVP certification, review and recertification must include the names, titles, and sample signatures of designated officials. An SEVP-certified school must update SEVIS upon any changes to the persons who are principal or designated officials, and furnish the name, title and e-mail address of any new official within 21 days of the change. Any changes to the PDSO or DSO must be made by the PDSO within 21 days of the change. DHS may, at its discretion, reject the submission of any individual as a DSO or withdraw a previous submission by a school of an individual.
(3) Statement of designated officials. A petition for school approval must include a statement by each designated official certifying that the official is familiar with the Service regulations relating to the requirements for admission and maintenance of status of nonimmigrant students, change of nonimmigrant status under part 248 of this chapter, and school approval under §§214.3 and 214.4, and affirming the official's intent to comply with these regulations. At the time a new designated official is added, the designated official must make the same certification.

(a) General—(1) Denial of certification. The petitioning school will be notified of the reasons and appeal rights if a petition for certification is denied, in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 103.3(a)(1)(iii). A petitioning school denied certification may file a new petition for certification at any time.
(2) Denial of recertification or withdrawal on notice. The school must wait at least one calendar year from the date of denial of recertification or withdrawal on notice before being eligible to petition again for SEVP certification if a school's petition for recertification is denied by SEVP pursuant to 8 CFR 214.3(h)(3)(v), or its certification is withdrawn on notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. Eligibility to re-petition will be at the discretion of the Director of SEVP. SEVP certification of a school or school system for the attendance of nonimmigrant students, pursuant to sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) and/or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, will be withdrawn on notice subsequent to out-of-cycle review, or recertification denied, if the school or school system is determined to no longer be entitled to certification for any valid and substantive reason including, but not limited to, the following:
(i) Failure to comply with 8 CFR 214.3(g)(1) without a subpoena.
(ii) Failure to comply with 8 CFR 214.3(g)(2).

(xi) Issuance of Forms I-20 to aliens who will not be enrolled in or carry full courses of study, as defined in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6) or 214.2(m)(9).
(xii) Failure to operate as a bona fide institution of learning.
(xiii) Failure to employ adequate qualified professional personnel.
(xiv) Failure to limit advertising in the manner prescribed in 8 CFR 214.3(j).

(3) Automatic withdrawal. A school that is automatically withdrawn and subsequently wishes to enroll nonimmigrant students in the future may file a new petition for SEVP certification at any time. The school must use the certification petition procedures described in 8 CFR 214.3(h)(1) to gain access to SEVIS for submitting its petition. Past compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l), and with the requirements for transition of students under paragraph (i) of this section will be considered in the evaluation of a school's subsequent petition for certification. SEVP certification will be automatically withdrawn:
(i) As of the date of termination of operations, if an SEVP-certified school terminates its operations.
(ii) As of a school's certification expiration date, if an SEVP-certified school does not submit a completed recertification petition in the manner required by 8 CFR 214.3(h)(2).
(iii) Sixty days after the change of ownership if an SEVP-certified school changes ownership, unless the school files a new petition for SEVP certification, in accordance with the procedures at 8 CFR 214.3(h)(1), within 60 days of the change of ownership. SEVP will review the petition if the school properly files such petition to determine whether the school still meets the eligibility requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(a)(3) and is still in compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l). SEVP will institute withdrawal proceedings in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section if, upon completion of the review, SEVP finds that the school is no longer eligible for certification, or is not in compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l).
(iv) If an SEVP-certified school voluntarily withdraws from its certification.
(4) Automatic withdrawal as of SEVIS mandatory compliance date. The present approval of any school that has not filed for enrollment in SEVIS by the mandatory compliance date for attendance of nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act is automatically withdrawn as of the day following the mandatory compliance date for SEVIS. Given the time necessary to conduct a review of each school, the Service will review and adjudicate Form I-17 petitions for approval in SEVIS prior to the SEVIS mandatory compliance date only for Form I-17 petitions filed at least 75 days prior to this mandatory date. If a Form I-17 petition is filed less than 75 days prior to the mandatory compliance date and is not adjudicated prior to the mandatory compliance date, the school will not be authorized to access SEVIS and will be unable to issue any SEVIS Forms I-20 until the adjudication is complete.
(b) Withdrawal on notice. SEVP will initiate an out-of-cycle review and serve the school with an NOIW if SEVP has information that a school or school system may no longer be entitled to SEVP certification prior to the school being due for its two-year recertification. The NOIW will inform the school of:
(1) The grounds for withdrawing SEVP certification.
(2) The 30-day deadline from the date of the service of the NOIW for the school to submit sworn statements, and documentary or other evidence, to rebut the grounds for withdrawal of certification in the NOIW. An NOIW is not a means for the school to submit evidence that it should have previously submitted as a part of its established reporting requirements.
(3) The school's right to submit a written request (including e-mail) within 30 days of the date of service of the NOIW for a telephonic interview in support of its response to the NOIW.
(c) Assistance of counsel. The school or school system shall also be informed in the notice of intent to withdraw approval that it may be assisted or represented by counsel of its choice qualified under part 292 of this chapter, at no expense to the Government, in preparation of its answer or in connection with the interview.
(d) Allegations admitted or no answer filed. If the school or school system admits all of the allegations in the notice of intent to withdraw approval, or if the school or school system fails to file an answer within the 30-day period, the district director shall withdraw the approval previously granted and he/she shall notify the designated school official of the decision. No appeal shall lie from the district director's decision if all allegations are admitted or no answer is filed within the 30-day period.
(e) Allegations denied. If the school or school system denies the allegations in the notice of intent to withdraw approval, then the school or school system shall, in its answer, provide all information or evidence on which the answer is based.
(f) Interview requested. (1) If in its answer to the notice of intent to withdraw approval the school or school system requests an interview, the school or school system shall be given notice of the date set for the interview.
(2) A summary of the information provided by the school or school system at the interview shall be prepared and included in the record. In the discretion of the district director, the interview may be recorded.
(g) Decision. The decision of SEVP will be in accordance with 8 CFR 103.3(a)(1).
(h) Appeals. Notices of denial or withdrawal of SEVP certification will include appeal alternatives and filing instructions. Any appeal must be taken within 15 days after the service of the decision by stating the reasons for the appeal in the notice of appeal provided with the instructions, and supported by a statement or brief specifically setting forth the grounds for contesting the withdrawal of the approval. No fee is required with appeals related to denial of SEVP recertification or withdrawal of SEVP certification.
(i) Operations at a school when SEVP certification is relinquished or withdrawn, or whose recertification is denied and on the SEVIS access termination date—(1) General. A school whose certification is relinquished or withdrawn, or whose recertification is denied may, at SEVP discretion, no longer be able to create Initial student records or issue new Forms I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student, for initial attendance. Schools must comply with the instructions given in the notice of withdrawal or denial with regard to management of status for their Initial and continuing F and/or M students. All other SEVIS functionality, including event reporting for students, will remain unchanged until the school's SEVIS access termination date. The school must continue to comply with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) until its SEVIS access termination date.
(2) SEVIS access termination. In determining the SEVIS access termination date, SEVP will consider the impact that such date will have upon SEVP, the school, and the school's nonimmigrant students in determining the SEVIS access termination date. In most situations, SEVP will not determine a SEVIS access termination date for that school until the appeals process has concluded and the initial denial or withdrawal has been upheld unless a school whose certification is withdrawn or whose recertification is denied is suspected of criminal activity or poses a potential national security threat. The school will no longer be able to access SEVIS, and SEVP will automatically terminate any remaining Active SEVIS records for that school on the SEVIS access termination date.
(3) Legal obligations and ramifications for a school and its DSOs when a school is having SEVP certification denied or withdrawn. Schools are obligated to their students to provide the programs of study to which they have committed themselves in the students' application for enrollment and acceptance process. Schools are obligated to the U.S. government to comply with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements contained in 8 CFR 214.3. With any new petition for SEVP certification, SEVP will consider the extent to which a school has fulfilled these obligations to students and the U.S. government during any previous period of SEVP certification.

(2) Dependents of F, M, or J nonimmigrants. The principal alien must pay the fee, when required under this section, in order for his/her qualifying dependents to obtain F-2, J-2, or M-2 status. However, an F-2, J-2, or M-2 dependent is not required to pay a separate fee under this section in order to obtain that status or during the time he/she remains in that status.
(3) A nonimmigrant described in paragraph (a) of this section whose Form I-20 or Form DS-2019 for initial attendance was issued on or before August 31, 2004.
(c) Special Fee for Certain J-1 Nonimmigrants. A J-1 exchange visitor coming to the United States as an au pair, camp counselor, or participant in a summer work/travel program is subject to a fee of $35.
(d) Time for payment of SEVIS fee. An alien who is subject to payment of the SEVIS fee must remit the fee directly to DHS as follows:
(1) An alien seeking an F-1, F-3, J-1, M-1, or M-3 visa from a consular officer abroad for initial attendance at a DHS-approved school or to commence participation in a Department of State-designated exchange visitor program, must pay the fee to DHS before issuance of the visa.
(2) An alien who is exempt from the visa requirement described in section 212(d)(4) of the Act must pay the fee to DHS before the alien applies for admission at a U.S. port-of-entry to begin initial attendance at a DHS-approved school or initial participation in a Department of State-designated exchange visitor program.
(3) A nonimmigrant alien in the United States seeking a change of status to F-1, F-3, J-1, M-1, or M-3 must pay the fee to DHS before the alien is granted the change of nonimmigrant status, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(4) A J-1 nonimmigrant who is applying for a change of program category within the United Status, in accordance with 22 CFR 62.42, must pay the fee associated with that new category, if any, prior to being granted such a change.
(5) A J-1 nonimmigrant initially granted J-1 status to participate in a program sponsored by the Federal government, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and transferring in accordance with 22 CFR 62.42 to a program that is not similarly sponsored, must pay the fee associated with the new program prior to completing the transfer.
(6) A J-1 nonimmigrant who is applying for reinstatement after a substantive violation of status, or who has been out of program status for longer than 120 days but less than 270 days during the course of his/her program must pay a new fee to DHS, if applicable, prior to being granted a reinstatement to valid J-1 status.
(7) An F or M student who is applying for reinstatement of student status because of a violation of status, and who has been out of status for a period of time that exceeds the presumptive ineligibility deadline set forth in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(16)(i)(A) or (m)(16)(i)(A), must pay a new fee to DHS prior to being granted a return to valid status.
(8) An F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 nonimmigrant who has been absent from the United States for a period that exceeds 5 months in duration, and wishes to reenter the United States to engage in further study in the same course of study, with the exception of students who have been working toward completion of a U.S. course of study in authorized overseas study, must pay a new fee to DHS prior to being granted student status.
(e) Circumstances where no new fee is required.
(1) Extension of stay, transfer, or optional practical training for students. An F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 nonimmigrant is not required to pay a new fee in connection with:
(i) An application for an extension of stay, as provided in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(7) or (m)(10);
(ii) An application for transfer, as provided in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(8) or (m)(11);
(iii) A change in educational level, as provided in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(ii); or
(iv) An application for post-completion practical training, as provided in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii) or (m)(14).
(2) Extension of program or transfer for exchange visitors. A J-1 nonimmigrant is not required to pay a new fee in connection with:
(i) An application for an extension of program, as provided in 22 CFR 62.43; or
(ii) An application for transfer of program, as provided in 22 CFR 62.42.
(3) Visa issuance for a continuation of study. An F-1, F-3, J-1, M-1, or M-3 nonimmigrant who has previously paid the fee is not required to pay a new fee in order to be granted a visa to return to the United States as a continuing student or exchange visitor in a single course of study, so long as the nonimmigrant is not otherwise required to pay a new fee in accordance with the other provisions in this section.
(4) Certain changes in student classification.
(i) No fee is required for changes between the F-1 and F-3 classifications, and no fee is required for changes between the M-1 and M-3 classifications.
(ii) Institutional reclassification. DHS retains the discretionary authority to waive the additional fee requirement when a nonimmigrant changes classification between F and M, if the change of status is due solely to institutional reclassification by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program during that nonimmigrant's course of study.
(5) Re-application following denial of application by consular officer. An alien who fully paid a SEVIS fee in connection with an initial application for an F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 visa, or a J-1 visa in a particular program category, whose initial application was denied, and who is reapplying for the same status, or the same J-1 exchange visitor category, within 12 months following the initial notice of denial is not required to repay the SEVIS fee.
(6) Re-application following denial of an application for a change of status. A nonimmigrant who fully paid a SEVIS fee in connection with an initial application for a change of status within in the United States to F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 classification, or for a change of status to a particular J-1 exchange visitor category, whose initial application was denied, and who is granted a motion to reopen the denied case is not required to repay the SEVIS fee if the motion to reopen is granted within 12 months of receipt of initial notice of denial.
(f) [Reserved]
(g) Procedures for payment of the SEVIS fee. (1) Options for payment. An alien subject to payment of a fee under this section may pay the fee by any procedure approved by DHS, including:
(2) Receipts. DHS will provide a receipt for each fee payment under paragraph (g)(1) of this section until such time as DHS issues a notice in the Federal Register that paper receipts will no longer be necessary. Further receipt provisions include:
(3) Electronic record of fee payment. DHS will maintain an electronic record of payment for the alien as verification of receipt of the required fee under this section. If DHS records indicate that the fee has been paid, an alien who has lost or did not receive a receipt for a fee payment under this section will not be denied an immigration benefit, including visa issuance or admission to the United States, solely because of a failure to present a paper receipt of fee payment.
(4) Third-party payments. DHS will accept payment of the required fee for an alien from an approved school or a designated exchange visitor program sponsor, or from another source, in accordance with procedures approved by DHS.
(h) Failure to pay the fee. The failure to pay the required fee is grounds for denial of F, M, or J nonimmigrant status or status-related benefits. Payment of the fee does not preserve the lawful status of any F, J, or M nonimmigrant that has violated his or her status in some other manner.

Congratulations on your decision to study in the United States. Nonimmigrant students who come to the United States to study must follow specific rules. However, different rules apply depending on your student type and education level. Learn what student type and education level applies to you below:
Student Type:
Education Level:

Your first step is to apply to a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school in the United States. Use the School Search tool to find SEVP-certified schools and programs that are eligible to enroll F-1 and M-1 students. For more information about the types of programs that are available to you, please visit EducationUSA.
If you are a student currently enrolled in the equivalent of a kindergarten through grade 12 program, visit the Kindergarten to Grade 12 page on Study in the States.
The Form I-20
Once you are accepted into an SEVP-certified school, your school’s designated school official will send you a document called the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” The Form I-20 is a paper record of your information in our Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) database. Each school that accepts you will mail you a Form I-20.
For more information, visit the Students and the Form I-20 page.
After receiving your Form I-20, you must pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee.
Federal regulations require all F, M and J students pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee before applying for their U.S. student visa. You can pay your I-901 SEVIS Fee online at FMJfee.com or by using Western Union Quick Pay. You must present the receipt as proof of payment when you apply for visa. It’s important that the SEVIS ID number on your I-901 SEVIS Fee receipt matches your SEVIS ID number on your Form I-20. If it does not, or you encounter other issues paying your fee, please contact SEVP.
I-901 SEVIS Fee Assistance:
Learn more about the I-901 SEVIS Fee:
After paying the I-901 SEVIS Fee and getting a receipt, you must apply for a visa at any U.S. Embassy or Consulate before you come to the United States.
To receive a visa, you will have to participate in an in-person interview. During your visa interview, you will need to establish that you meet the requirements under U.S. law to receive the category of visa for which you are applying. The consular officer will determine if you qualify to receive a visa and which visa category is appropriate based on your purpose of travel.
A visa does not guarantee entrance to the United States; it only permits you to arrive and seek permission to enter the country. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the U.S. port of entry has the final authority to admit entry into the country.
The following pages will assist with this process:
Before you leave for the United States, familiarize yourself with the different documents you will need or could need when you arrive. It is also a good idea to make at least two sets of copies of these documents: one copy to leave with your family before you depart and one copy to give to your school officials. Required documents include your:
It is also smart to have your acceptance letter, proof of financial ability and any other supporting documentation with you, in case the Customs and Border Protection officer asks for them. You should carry your original travel documents on you at all times while traveling. Do not put them in your checked baggage. For more information on traveling to the United States, visit the Getting to the United States page.
When you arrive to the United States you will meet a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry, who will verify your information and determine if you may enter the country.
If the officer cannot initially verify your information, or if you do not have all of the required documentation, you may be directed to an interview area known as “secondary inspection.” Secondary inspection allows inspectors to conduct additional research in order to verify information without causing delays for other arriving passengers.
The inspector will first attempt to verify your status by using SEVIS. In the event that the CBP officer needs to verify information with your school or program, we strongly recommend that you have the name and telephone number of the designated school official (DSO) at your school on hand. If you arrive during non-business hours (evening, weekends, holidays), you should also have an emergency or non-business hour phone number available for this official.
Failure to comply with U.S. government entry-exit procedures may result in your being denied entry to the United States. Under certain circumstances, the CBP officer may issue a Form I-515A, “Notice to Student or Exchange Visitor,” which authorizes temporary admission into the United States. Work with your school without delay to submit the proper documentation required by the Form I-515A. Failing to comply with a Form I-515A will result in the termination of your status. Read SEVP’s Form I-515A Noncompliance Termination procedure to ensure you understand how to properly respond and maintain your status.
If the CBP officer admits you into the country, you will be given a Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record.” This form shows that you have been legally admitted into the United States, the class of admission and your authorized period of stay. It is very important that the information on the record is correct. Inconsistencies between the information on the Form I-94 and SEVIS records can reduce the chances of a successful systems interface and can result in denial of benefits or difficulty re-entering the country.
You have 30 days to enter the country before your official program start date, as listed on your Form I-20. If you do not report to your school by your program start date, your DSO may terminate your SEVIS record. We suggest that you contact your school immediately once you enter the country so that there is no question of your arrival.
If you cannot enter the United States for the term listed on your Form I-20, contact your school officials as soon as possible so that they can update your record so your plans are accurately reflected in SEVIS.
As an F or M student, you will often hear the phrase “maintaining status.” Maintaining your status means that you are fulfilling the purpose for why the U.S. Department of State issued you your visa and following the regulations associated with that purpose. Remember, a student visa is a travel document you receive from a U.S. consulate or embassy before you enter the United States. Your student status is what you must maintain after you are granted entrance into the United States. Learn more about the rules you must follow by talking to your DSO and reviewing the Maintaining Status page on Study in the States.
While studying in the United States, you may be eligible to apply for certain benefits. These student benefits are not granted by SEVP and require students to apply to other government agencies to receive them. The benefits you are eligible for will depend on your student status. Visit the following pages to learn more about potential student benefits:
As a note, most employment and training opportunities require authorization from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). For more information, visit the Employment page on ICE.gov.
If you are having an immediate problem and need assistance quickly, please speak with your DSO or responsible officer. If that person cannot help you, contact the SEVP Response Center at 1-703-603-3400 or at SEVP@ice.dhs.gov.
Once you have completed your program and fulfilled your purpose for coming to the United States, you may have a number of options. These include changing your status, applying for training, transferring to another SEVP-certified school or leaving the country.
Please note there are restrictions that apply to M-1 students regarding transferring and changing status. Talk to your DSO to understand what your options are.
If after your program is complete you do not qualify to stay in the country, or chose to depart, please be advised:
You can also visit USCIS to learn about naturalization and the path to U.S. citizenship.

On April 2, 2024, the U.S.
On Feb. 21, 2023, the U.S. Department of State announced that consular officers can issue an F or M student visa up to 365 days in advance of an international student’s Program Start Date. Previously, student visas could only be issued up to 120 days before a student’s Program Start Date. 

Students can still only enter the United States 30 days before the Program Start Date listed on their Form I-20, “Certificate Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” Both students and school officials should ensure the following prior to a student’s arrival at a U.S. port of entry:  
This new guidance does not change the requirement for issuing Forms I-20 in SEVIS, paying the I-901 SEVIS Fee or seeking admission into the United States.
Additionally, the State Department published a final rule on March 28, 2023, to announce an increase to certain nonimmigrant visa application processing fees, including student and exchange visitor visa fees. The cost for student and exchange visitor visas will increase from $160 to $185 starting May 30, 2023.

How to Apply for the F-1 Student Visa - Boundless Immigration,"Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
What is the F-1 visa?
The F-1 visa allows a student to temporarily live in the United States for a defined period of time while studying at a school, college, seminary, or conservatory.
Is the F-1 visa right for me?
For many students, the chance to study in the United States is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. Unless the person is already a U.S. citizen or green card holder, all prospective students will have to apply for a visa to study in the United States.
Because there are so many courses and places to study in the United States, the F-1 visa has a pretty broad application but also some very clear rules. The first is that you have to be coming to the United States with the intent to temporarily study. In other words, this is not an immigrant visa.
You must be studying at an academic institution, not training at a vocational school, as this will require an M-1 visa. Your academic institution must be approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning it needs to be accredited to be able to accept foreign students on F-1 visas.
You will be able to work, but because this is a non-immigrant visa, you will be restricted to where you can work and the type of work. Finally, although your spouse and children can come with you, they will not be able to work but your children can enroll in schools. They will be on F-2 visas and tied to your visa’s status.
Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have. Learn more about what we do to help.
The requirements for an F-1 visa are:
For many students, the process of applying and being accepted into a U.S. academic institution is the lengthiest part. The visa process is a series of steps that take place after you accept an enrollment offer. Not sure if you qualify for an F-1 student visa? Start by checking your eligibility.
Congratulations, you have been accepted into a course of study by a U.S. academic institution! Years of hard work probably led you to this milestone, so here’s the process to obtain your student visa.
After your SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be added to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVP uses SEVIS to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M, and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.
Once you have registered with SEVIS, you will need to pay the I-901 fee. This fee is currently $350 for most people, and funds the SEVP program.
Your SEVP-approved school will then issue you a Form I-20. This form is incredibly important as it confirms your acceptance at the school, and therefore your eligibility for the F-1 visa. Once this Form I-20 has been issued, you will be able to apply to a U.S. embassy or consulate for your F-1 visa.
The steps required will vary between different U.S. embassies or consulates, so make sure you check their websites for further information.
However, you must complete the Form DS-160, which is similar to the Form DS-260 for immigrant visas. The form is very detailed and can take some time to fill in, so make sure you set aside plenty of time to complete it.
Once you have completed the Form DS-160, you will need to schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, unless you are under 13 years of age or over 80 years of age. The U.S. Department of State says you should schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country where you live. You may schedule your interview at another U.S. embassy or consulate, but be aware that it may be more difficult to qualify for a visa outside of the country where you live.
Prior to your interview, you will need to pay the $185 application fee and also, depending on your nationality, pay an issuance fee, as well. The visa issuance fee is only due after your interview, if your visa is approved. The next step will be an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate.
Visa wait times can vary depending on the time of year and location. You can use the appointment wait time tool to see how long you will have to wait for an appointment at a specific U.S. embassy or consulate.
At this stage, it is important to note that F-1 visas for new students can only be issued up to 365 days (one year) in advance of the start date for a course of study. It used to be 120 days, but in February, 2023, the State Department extended the period.
Note: For existing F-1 visas, this is not the case and visas can be issued any time, as long as the student is currently enrolled at a SEVP-approved school or institution and in SEVIS.
Boundless not only makes it easy for you to complete your F-1 student visa application, but we can also help you get ready for your visa interview. Learn more about what you get with Boundless.
You will generally be required to attend an interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate. You will need to bring:
You should also be prepared to bring evidence of:
During your interview, the consular officer will ask you questions to determine whether or not to approve your F-1 visa. Make sure you are complete and accurate in your answers, as you will be under oath. For interview tips, see the Boundless guide on preparing for the F-1 student visa interview.
The consular officer will also take your fingerprints, although this will vary depending on your location. After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing. The consular officer will let you know if this is required.
Once your interview is complete, you will be informed of the outcome and, if successful, be issued a visa to study in the United States.
Get exclusive visa interview prep materials from a former U.S. consular officer when you work with Boundless on your student visa application. Learn more.
Yes, you can bring your spouse and children with you. Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
F-1 students cannot work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students can engage in three types of off-campus employment:
This depends on your individual taxation situation, but typically you might be required to file a U.S. tax return. For more information, seek advice from a qualified tax professional.
Generally, an F-1 student may transfer between SEVP-certified schools. However, this does involve paperwork and coordination. See here for more detailed instructions.
There are some programs and visas available for F-1 visa holders after you finish studying in the United States. These can be highly individual to your circumstances, field of study, and professional background, so do your research carefully.

You don’t have to navigate the F-1 student visa process alone. Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have along the way. Learn more about what we do to help.

Student Visa


Exchange Visitor Visa


Generally, a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

To enter the United States to attend:

Private elementary school
Seminary
Conservatory
Another academic institution, including a language training program
Vocational or other recognized nonacademic institution, other than a language training program

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.

"F-1 Visas for International Students: Requirements, Rules ...","Get ready to study abroad in America with our step-by-step guide to F-1 visa rules. 
Students wishing to study in the United States need to learn about the F-1 student visa application process. There are more than one million international students currently studying abroad in the USA, and with some preparation and guidance, you can join them. To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. The I-20 form provided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with your F-1 visa after graduation.
Have questions about the student visa process? Attend an upcoming Shorelight webinar > 
There are several F-1 visa rules to keep in mind if you plan to apply for a F-1 student visa. You must meet these requirements for your application to be accepted:
Institution certification—The college or the university where you plan to study needs to be approved by SEVP Immigration & Customs Enforcement.
Full-time enrollment—You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution while your academic term is in session.
English language proficiency—You must meet the required English language proficiency score of the institution you are attending or be enrolled in courses that will help you improve your English proficiency.
Sufficient funding—You must prove you have sufficient funds available to finance your studies and living expenses while in the US.
Valid passport—Your passport should be valid for US travel for at least six months after your program completion date.
Home country residency—You are required to have a residence in your home country to return to following the completion of your degree.

Before you begin your F-1 visa application, you must take the following steps:
Get accepted by a SEVP-certified institution before submitting your visa application. When you are accepted, you will receive your I-20 form, which you will need to apply for your F-1 visa.
Pay your SEVIS fee.
Complete your DS-160 visa application.
Schedule your visa interview.
Attend your visa interview.
If you are applying for a F-1 visa from India, Shorelight’s F-1 visa for Indian students guide is for you.
Once these steps are completed, you will be ready to complete and submit your F-1 student visa application. 
1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US government’s way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education. 
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay. 
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials. 
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., like getting a US driver’s license). 
Helpful resources: Confirm your US university is a SEVP-accredited institution 
Keep your Shorelight enrollment advisor updated through every step of the visa process – when you submit your application, schedule your visa interview, and, of course, when your visa application is approved.
2. Pay Your SEVIS Fee
The total cost for your F-1 student visa will be approximately $510, which includes the cost of the visa itself, plus SEVIS processing and maintenance fees. 
Requirements: Your I-20
Cost: $350 
Where to apply: Payment portal for your SEVIS fee
Make sure to save the I-901 SEVIS fee receipt. You will need it for your visa interview. 
3. Complete Your DS-160 Visa Application
Your DS-160 is your visa application. All prospective international students must complete a DS-160 to receive an F-1 visa. 
Requirements: Your I-20, passport, travel itinerary, photo for your visa
Cost: $160 
Where to apply: Application portal for your DS-160
After you successfully submit your DS-160, you will receive a printed confirmation with a barcode on it. Save this form – you will need it for your visa interview. 
4. Schedule Your Visa Interview
Find the nearest US embassy or consulate and schedule your visa interview. Wait times will vary by country and can take months — so remember to set up your appointments as early as possible!
If you are enrolling at a US university through Shorelight, ask your enrollment advisor about student visa interview tips or how to set up a mock interview session. Practicing your visa interview in advance will make you feel more comfortable with the process.
Ask your Shorelight advisor to set up a mock visa interview for you.
5. Attend Your Visa Interview
During the interview portion of the F-1 visa application process, the US consulate or embassy confirms you are coming to study as a legitimate, serious student. In your visa interview, you must also prove you have the funds to cover your time studying in the US, and confirm that you plan on returning home after your studies are complete. Attending your visa interview in person is required, though there are a few rare exceptions (e.g., if you are younger than 14 or older than 80 years of age, or if you meet certain visa renewal requirements). 
Cost: Your DS-160 payment covers the cost
Where to apply: Scheduling portal for your visa interview
After you successfully complete your visa interview, you will be granted your F-1 visa and acquire F-1 status. You are now cleared to study in the USA! 
Refer to Travel.state.gov to learn more. If you need any help with preparing or submitting your application, Shorelight provides application assistance for international students.
Before you attend your visa interview, make sure to have the following documents ready for evaluation by the consular officer:
A valid passport
A copy of the photo you will use for your visa
Printed copies of your DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmations
I-20 form
School transcript and official test scores cited on your university application
Diploma (if applicable)
Bank statements or other proof of finances
During your interview, the consular officer may request additional documents. To prepare, consider bringing the following documents:
Academic records such as transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates from schools you attended
Standardized test scores required by your US institution
Evidence of your intent to depart the United States upon completion of your course of study
Statements proving your ability to pay all educational, living, and travel costs
As an international student, you might feel uncertain about your upcoming interview. While feeling nervous is normal, do not forget to take a deep breath and remember that you are well prepared! Your interview is important, but should not be stressful.
Your interviewer will ask questions to determine: 
Are you a legitimate student?
Do you have the resources to pay for your studies?
Do you plan to return home after completing your degree?
To prepare for your F-1 student visa interview, here are some questions you might be asked: 
Why did you pick this university?
Which other US universities did you apply to?
How will you pay for your education?
Do you have relatives in the USA?
Do you plan to work while in the USA?
What do you plan to do after graduation?
Your Shorelight advisor can help you prepare for your interview by giving you a detailed overview of what the process will involve. They can also help you practice with mock interviews! Shorelight’s F-1 student visa interview guide can also help you learn more about what you can do to prepare for your upcoming interview. 
There is a possibility that your F-1 visa application will be denied. If this happens, you will be given detailed reasoning in writing, including the section of the law that led to the denial of your application.  
To avoid having your F-1 student visa application denied, it is important to read and follow all instructions carefully. Always double- and triple-check your documents before submitting your application. Shorelight advisors can offer visa assistance to make this process easier for you: They are happy to help you organize all the documents you will need, in the correct formats, and on schedule. 
Remember: During your F-1 student visa interview, you want to sufficiently demonstrate that you are traveling to the US to study and planning to return to your home country once your program is complete. Keep this in mind as you answer your interview questions.
As an international student, you must actively maintain your F-1 status to continue studying in the US. To do this, you must comply with both university regulations and codes of conduct, as well as with the requirements and conditions set out in your F-1 visa requirements. 
When entering the US:
Make sure to enter the US no more than 30 days before your program begins.
As soon as you arrive in the country, contact your designated school official (DSO).
When you arrive at your university, contact your DSO again before the start date listed on your I-20 form.
While studying in the US:
Attend all your classes and maintain good academic standing. If you require support with any of your classes, your Shorelight advisor can direct you to academic resources to help you improve.
If you need extra time to complete your program which would exceed the end date specified in your I-20, speak with your DSO to discuss your options for possible extensions.
Make sure to enroll for a full course of study when your academic term is in session.
If you want to drop a class or change classes, make sure to speak to your DSO first.
If you want to take a break and/or go on vacation, remember to first complete at least one full academic year at your institution.  After your holiday, you must also register for classes in the next academic term.
Yes, you will be able to work in the US on a F-1 student visa. However, you will have to follow certain F-1 visa rules and restrictions:
You can only work part time on campus while your academic term is in session
You can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week
You may be able to work off campus with the approval of your university
During academic breaks, you will be permitted to work full time, if your university allows it. You can learn more about working as a F-1 international student by referring to USCIS.gov.
When searching for work while you study, make sure to seek approval from your DSO first. 
Keep in mind, once you finish your program, you will have a grace period of 60 days to leave the US. If you wish to extend your stay, you can speak to a Shorelight advisor to explore your options, such as transferring to another school or pursuing further education. You can also refer to Shorelight’s F-1 extension guide to have a look at your options.
Now that you know how US non-immigrant visas work for international students, create a checklist of next steps and get started. The sooner you begin fulfilling the USA study visa requirements, the better chance you will have of securing your spot at an American university.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.

International students who wish to enter the United States for the purposes of furthering their studies can apply for an F1 Student Visa.
Call us on +1 844 290 6312 for immediate help & assistance with your situation. We’re here to help you in person, via the phone, or online.

The F1 Visa allows eligible international students who wish to attend a full course of study at colleges, universities, and high schools in the United States. The academic institution attended must be certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). In addition, this student visa can be used by foreign nationals coming to the country to attend a language training program.
While in the country, international students are free not only to study and live in the United States but they can also travel abroad without losing their visa status. In addition, F1 visa holders can open a bank account and obtain a driver’s license.
Furthermore, the F1 Visa cannot be used to attend publicly funded adult education programs. Those who would like to pursue a course of study that is not academic, such as post-secondary vocational or business schools, should apply for an M-1 Visa.
The Student Visa does not have an annual cap, meaning that the visa application can be processed as soon as it is submitted which is only a few business days.
To be eligible for this student visa, international students must meet the following requirements:
If you would like to apply for a student F1 visa, you will first need to apply to a SEVP-approved academic institution. For a list of SEVP-certified schools, you should go to Study in the States to search for a list of approved academic institutions.
You must then be registered in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) where you will need to pay the SEVIS I-901 fee. After the SEVIS fee payment has been made, you will then be issued Form I-20 from your school.
If you have eligible dependents (spouses and unmarried children under 21) that you would like to bring with you to the US, they must also enroll in SEVIS to obtain their individual I-20 Forms for their dependent F2 visas. Dependents do not need to pay the SEVIS fee.
You may then begin the F-1 visa application process at your nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. To do this, the visa applicants will need to complete Form DS-160 (Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application), submit supporting documentation, and attend a visa interview.
You can file your application form online or at your local U.S. Embassy or Consulate. For the F1 Visa, you will need the following supporting documents to make your visa application:
The last step of your application is an interview, which is required to determine whether or not you qualify for a Student Visa. If you are abroad, this will take place at your nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.
At this visa interview, the consular officer will review your documents and ask you questions about your academic qualifications and choice of university. They will ask questions about the course you are planning to take, as well as your reasons behind opting to study in the US.
You will be required to demonstrate your willingness to return to your home country at the end of your course of study and future plans.
Most importantly, you will need to prove that you have enough means to finance your education and your life in the U.S. The interviewer may ask about your income, who is sponsoring your education and how you plan to cover living expenses while studying.
Attending a visa interview can be daunting so make sure you prepare in advance. Try to keep your answers concise and factual.

One of the F-1 Visa requirements is to prove that you do not wish to settle in the United States. To help prove that you do not want to immigrate to the United States, visa applicants must show they maintain strong ties with their home country.
To support their F-1 Visa application, visa applicants may prove their non-immigrant intent by demonstrating the following:
Your visa also indicates the amount of time you can legally stay in the U.S. This usually coincides with the total length of your studies. However, if you need extra time, you can apply for an F-1 Visa renewal.
You need to produce a letter stating the reason for your request so that your designated school official can extend your permit.
If you are going to travel abroad for a short time and your F-1 Visa will expire while you are away, you will need to re-apply for it before you can re-enter the country.
If you fail to maintain your F1 Visa status, you will lose your right to live and study in the U.S.
This can happen as a result of one of the following circumstances:
You can enter the U.S. 30 days before the registration date printed on your Firm I-20. In addition, you have a further 60 day grace period in the country following the completion of your course.
If you have been admitted to a U.S. university, but are still waiting for your I-20, you may travel to the U.S. for a valid reason. For example, you may need to attend your visa interview appointment at the consulate. In this case, you can submit an application for a B-2 Visitor Visa with a “prospective student” annotation. This permit will let you enter the country for a short time.
It should be noted that foreign students may not study after entering on a visitor visa (B2 Visa) or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) unless that study is recreational, non-credit, and an allowed program of study under the B-2 Tourist visa.
To get your F1 Visa status, you must be enrolled in a full-time program. Consequently, you may not have any free time to work. However, in limited circumstances, you may get permission to work part-time on-campus as a part of your practical training only after the first year of study is over. International students on an F-1 visa may engage in the following types of off-campus employment:
Those who would like to work off-campus in other types of off-campus employment can do so if they can prove that they are in severe economic hardship because of unforeseen circumstances. This may include:
As with any other U.S. visa, the F1 Student visa can be denied for a number of reasons. If you receive a rejection, the USCIS will detail the reasons for the denial in the rejection letter after the application has been processed. F1 Student visas can be rejected for a variety of reasons including the following:
To minimize your chances of the visa application being rejected, it is important that you complete the visa application thoroughly and truthfully. To make sure that your application is completed to the highest standard, it is recommended that an immigration lawyer experienced in handling student visas, check the application along with the portfolio of supporting documents.
Furthermore, an immigration attorney can also advise you on your options if you find that your application has been denied.
As well as the cost of education in the United States, international students will be expected to pay the following fees in order to obtain an F-1 visa:

The F1 Visa is a non-immigrant permit for international students, meaning it does not create a path to U.S. settlement. Consequently, you cannot directly move from an F1 visa to a Green Card.
While on a Student Visa, you are not allowed to apply for permanent residence. This would be considered a violation of status, resulting in a temporary ban from the U.S. However, you may try to adjust your status.
One good idea could be to apply for an H-1B visa. This permit is designed for foreign nationals that hold a degree in a specialized field, such as IT, finance, or science.
However, if you do not wish to contend your place with other participants in the annual lottery, you can file your I-129 Form to petition for other visas.
Once you have obtained a dual intent visa, you may immediately file for a Green Card. For example, if you already got a master’s degree, you may want to consider an EB-2 immigrant Green Card.
Before you can petition for a new status, you must have been in F1 status for at least one academic year.
U.S. visa processing time will depend on the U.S. Embassy or Consulate from where the international student is applying. Some embassies and consulates might take longer than others due to a backlog or a heavy workload.
Typically, visas can be processed anywhere from 3 days to several weeks. Of course, this will depend on the strength of the application and that no additional evidence or documents will be required. It should be noted that visa applications that require the submission of additional information can take months to process.
It is currently faster to apply for an F2B visa than an F1 visa. That said, this can change and it is always best to refer to the Department of State’s monthly visa bulletin for progress and updates on the various visas that are available for the US.
If your F1 visa application has been rejected and you wish to receive professional guidance, you can entrust your case with one of our immigration attorneys. IAS will assist in obtaining your F-1 Visa and deliver only the best strategy necessary for your application.

US student visa requirements, eligibility criteria, the application steps and FAQs
In this article
The F1 visa is a student visa that is given to international students who want to attend educational institutions in the United States. It covers levels from elementary school to university and graduate school, including other degrees.
To qualify to even apply for an F1 visa you must meet some specific conditions, such as:
Here are the documents required to apply for an F1 Visa:
To application process for the F1 visa goes through the following steps:
After you apply and are accepted into the school you want to attend, they will have to complete some procedures so that you can apply for the F1 visa. The most important document you need to have is Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status. Without this form, you will not be able to apply for an F1 student visa and attend your interview.
After you get your Form I-20, you can start the usual application process. This includes filing the DS-160 form online with the necessary information about your visa status.
The application fee for the student visa is $185. You must pay this fee and get the receipt, which you will need later for your interview documents. You might have to pay additional fees based on your country of origin and the US Embassy you are applying from.
When you are admitted by the SEVP institution, your school immediately registers you in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). To have full registration, there is a SEVIS I-901 fee. For the F1 visa, this fee is $200.
After filing the DS-160 form and paying the fees, you will need to schedule your interview. The interview is a mandatory step before you get your student visa. Try to schedule it as early as possible, since there might be delays due to the heavy workload of the US Embassy. When you schedule it, you will receive an interview appointment letter which you will need later on in the application process.
Before you go to attend your interview, you should prepare your file with the required documents for students.
When you go to attend the student visa interview, the questions will mostly revolve around your reasons for going to the US and the institution you are going to. The interviewer will try to assess whether you intend to return to your home country after you complete your degree.
When your visa is approved, it might be for the full time that you will be in school in the US, or for less. If your study program takes 1 year to graduate, the Embassy will most likely give you a visa that is valid for 1 year If your degree program is 2 years and you only get the visa for 1 year, you should then later apply to renew it. In this case, it is the best option to renew the F1 visa.
The validity of your F1 visa is for as long as it is stated on your I-20 form and I-94 form which is given to you when you enter the US.
If you are renewing your visa you should follow the same procedure. You might be able to waive the interview on the reason that you have already done it once and your intent is to continue your education for the remaining years to get your degree.
If your visa is approved, you are allowed to depart for the US 30 days before your program begins. You cannot enter the US any earlier than that.
In most cases, you will get the response on this visa immediately after the interview. At the end of the visa interview, the interviewer might congratulate you for getting the visa or will provide you with a document letting you know the reason for denial. This is because the processing of this type of visa actually happens before your interview. The interview is the last step for the US Embassy to assess whether they should issue the visa.
There are, however, cases where the response and processing of the F1 visa takes a few days, so you should be patient if that happens.
After you are admitted into the institution of your choice, you can apply for the visa 120 days before you are scheduled to start your program. You cannot apply any earlier, but applying later might cause you a delay due to processing times. So as soon as the 120-day countdown begins, make sure you submit your application.
After your visa expires, you have a 60 day grace period to prepare for your departure to your home country. If your visa doesn’t cover the whole time that you will be in school in the US, you will have to apply for renewal or extensions. The extensions are approved only if you can prove you will be completing your degree in the US and you intend to return as soon as it is over.
You may work as an F1 student but only for short periods of time since your visa is a student and not a work visa. You are allowed to work part-time on campus while school is in session and full time during breaks. If you want to work outside of campus, you have two options.
If you, for example, find a job that requires a different type of visa, other than F1, then you are also eligible to change status. You just need to work through the instructions of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and your employer or another petitioner.
Even though you have proved that you have strong ties to your home country, if you want to apply for a Green Card, you are allowed to do so on an F1 visa. It is a complicated procedure, though. You must either self-petition as a person with extraordinary abilities, get married in the US or prove that you will invest $500,000 in the US economy.
If these are not feasible for you, but you still want to remain in the US, the easiest way is to change status into a different type of visa such as an H-1B visa and have your employer sponsor you.
F1 visa students quite often have to travel abroad. They travel during university breaks or in case of emergencies. The travel can be to their own home countries or to other countries.
If you are an F1 visa student who wants to travel abroad, before you plan and book their travel you must follow some instructions. The instructions are to ensure that they can enter the United States again.
In case you have dependents, such as a spouse or unmarried children under 21 years old, they are allowed to come to the US too. This can be done with an F2 visa.
The F2 visa has no cap and dependents should just fulfill the requirements and complete the application procedures to get the visa. To be eligible for an F-2 visa, you must fulfill the following criteria:

F1 Student Visa - The Application Process and Interview Tips,"Register Now!






	An F1 visa is issued to international students who are attending an academic program or English Language Program at a US college or university. F1 students must maintain the minimum course load for full-time student status. They can remain in the US up to 60 days beyond the length of time it takes to complete their academic program, unless they have applied and been approved to stay and work for a period of time under the OPT Program.


	F1 students are expected to complete their studies by the expiration date on their I-20 form (Certificate of Eligibility for Non-immigrant Student Status) which is provided by the US college or university that the student has been accepted to and will attend.


		In order to qualify, applicants need to satisfy and prove several strict criteria during an F1 visa interview, including the following:
	

			Different universities have different admission policies. Your university will tell you what they need to determine if you are academically eligible. Among other requirements, you will need to show the school that you have enough money to support yourself while studying without having to work and you may have to show health insurance in order to cover any medical expenses should you need any medical assistance. Once the university has determined that your application is complete and you are academically eligible, they will issue an I-20 form to enable you to apply for your student visa.
		

			Applicants for student visas should generally apply at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate with jurisdiction over their place of permanent residence. This will normally be your home country — the country in which you live. Although visa applicants may apply at any U.S. consular office abroad, it may be more difficult to qualify for the visa outside the country of permanent residence.
		

Find a U.S. Embassy or Consulate

Founded by an experienced immigration lawyer in the US, F1 Visa Advisors offers a limited access program that provides students with personalized visa assistance and guidance to help increase their chance of getting approved an F1 visa.
		

	Always protect yourself by keeping a copy of everything that you fill out and send off.


		Although the process may vary or require additional steps, depending on your country and embassy or consulate, you will need the following when applying for your student visa:
	

Learn more about how to apply for your F1 Student Visa 

An F1 visa interview will be required to determine whether or not you are qualified to receive an F1 student visa. You should arrive at the interview with all of the required documents and receipts, and you should be prepared ahead of time to answer personal questions about your decision to study in the US. There are a number of common F1 Visa interview questions which we will look at below.


	If you've been denied your visa and would like to learn more about how to increase your chance of getting F1 visa approval, explore F1 Visa Advisors, Inc.

	If approved, you may be required to pay a visa issuance fee. Digital fingerprint scans will be taken for records. Your passport will be taken so that you can get your visa and you will be informed when you can get it back, either by pick-up or in the mail.


	Keep in mind that visa issuance is not guaranteed. Never make final travel plans until you have your visa approved. If your visa is denied, you will be given a reason based on the section of law which applies to your ineligibility. Filing a waiver of ineligibility is possible in some cases.


See more sample F1 Visa Interview Questions 

	If your F1 visa application is denied, it is based on US immigration law. If you are denied, the reason and section of law you are denied under will be given to you in your paperwork. Some applications are denied because the applicant failed to provide necessary information or supporting documentation as required. Sometimes, however, you can be found ineligible for other reasons.


	Of course, if you do not meet the F1 Visa Qualifications as stated above, you can expect to be found ineligible. For example, if you do not sufficiently demonstrate that the strong ties to your home country will influence you to return home after your stay in the US, you will be denied under INA section 214(b), Visa Qualifications and Immigrant Intent.


	Other common reasons for denial include Fraud or Misrepresentation, Unlawful Presence in the United States, Health-related grounds, Criminal-related grounds, or Security-related grounds. To learn more about visa denials and to see if you are eligible for a waiver or to reapply, the US Department of State website is a great resource.

	After you are approved for your F1 visa, you are able to enter the United States as an international student. However, after you arrive, you will need to stay aware of your obligations as an F1 visa holder. If you do not maintain your valid F1 visa status, you will not be allowed to return to re-enter the US if you leave and you will not be eligible for practical training (OPT or CPT) or on-campus employment. Here are some tips to assure you’re in good standing during your study abroad:


	Make sure you arrive in the US no more than 30 days prior to the first day of classes. Check in with your international advisor as soon as possible before your program begins.


	You must remain enrolled full time. Go to class and maintain passing grades. If you are having difficulty in your classes, notify your international advisor. If you are unable to complete your program by the date listed on your Form I-20, your international advisor can help you request a program extension.


	Your passport should be valid for at least 6-months in the future. Your country’s consulate or embassy can help you extend your passport if needed. Carry a copy of your passport with you along with your I-94 card for identification purposes.

Always notify your international advisor or office if you make changes to your address, study plans, or visa status.

	F1 visa students are not allowed to work off-campus. However, you may have some on-campus work or curricular practical training options if you qualify.

Students and the Form I-20 | Study in the States,"Official website of the Department of Homeland Security
On April 2, 2024, the U.S.

On April 2, 2024, the U.S.
All F and M students that study in the United States need a Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” Once accepted into a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school, international students will receive a Form I-20 from their designated school official (DSO). 
You must also obtain a Form I-20 for any eligible dependents you plan to bring to the United States with you. However, please note that the name (i.e., Academic and Language students vs. Vocational Students) on the Form I-20 an SEVP-certified school issues you will dictate the type of student visa you may obtain from the U.S. Department of State and the status you will need to maintain in the United States. You and your DSO must both sign the Form I-20. If you are under age 18, your parents must sign the Form I-20 for you.
The Form I-20 is an important document that you should keep safe, as you will need it throughout the international student life cycle.
Before you pay the I-901 Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) Fee, you must receive the Form I-20 from a DSO at the school you plan to attend. You will need information from the Form I-20 to pay the fee. The I-901 SEVIS Fee is mandatory and must be paid before you enter the United States. 
In order to pay the I-901 SEVIS fee, all prospective F and M students will need to provide their:
The Form I-20 lists your program start date, 30 days before which you are allowed to enter the United States. F-1 and M-1 student visas can be issued up to 365 days in advance of your course of study start date. Your type of student visa must match the type of Form I-20 you have (e.g., F-1 or M-1). You are expected to have the original Form I-20 at your visa interview. The consular officer may accept a copy of the Form I-20 in limited circumstances that warrant visa issuance prior to you receiving the original Form I-20.
You are expected to have the signed Form I-20 on hand as you enter the country. Do not pack it away in your suitcase. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer will instruct you to present your Form I-20 at the port of entry. You may arrive up to 30 days before the start date listed on your Form I-20; or
You need a Form I-20 if you are already in the United States as another type of nonimmigrant and you are applying to USCIS to change your status to F or M.
Your Form I-20 proves that you are legally enrolled in a program of study in the United States. Therefore, it may be needed when you apply for the benefits available to F and M students. If you are eligible to apply for a driver’s license or a social security number, remember to bring your Form I-20 with you.
After receiving the initial Form I-20 upon program acceptance, students may receive a new Form I-20 from their DSO in the following circumstances:
As of July 1, 2016, the redesigned Form I-20 is required for all F and M nonimmigrant visa applications, entry into the United States, travel and applications for nonimmigrant benefits. The previous version of the Form I-20 (with a barcode) is now invalid. Students please note that your DSOs were responsible for providing an updated, hard copy of the Form I-20 with original signatures to all F-1 and M-1 students at their schools.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.

Generally, a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.
While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa.  However, once you depart the United States you must apply for a new visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.

There is no guarantee you will be issued a visa. Do not make final travel plans or buy tickets until you have a visa.
For information about working in the United States during your study, review Students and Employment and Form I-765 Work Authorization Instructions on the USCIS website.
If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. The I-20 form provided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with your F-1 visa after graduation.

There are several F-1 visa rules to keep in mind if you plan to apply for a F-1 student visa. You must meet these requirements for your application to be accepted:
Institution certification—The college or the university where you plan to study needs to be approved by SEVP Immigration & Customs Enforcement.
Full-time enrollment—You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution while your academic term is in session.
English language proficiency—You must meet the required English language proficiency score of the institution you are attending or be enrolled in courses that will help you improve your English proficiency.
Sufficient funding—You must prove you have sufficient funds available to finance your studies and living expenses while in the US.
Valid passport—Your passport should be valid for US travel for at least six months after your program completion date.
Home country residency—You are required to have a residence in your home country to return to following the completion of your degree.

Before you begin your F-1 visa application, you must take the following steps:
Get accepted by a SEVP-certified institution before submitting your visa application. When you are accepted, you will receive your I-20 form, which you will need to apply for your F-1 visa.
Pay your SEVIS fee.
Complete your DS-160 visa application.
Schedule your visa interview.
Attend your visa interview.
If you are applying for a F-1 visa from India, Shorelight’s F-1 visa for Indian students guide is for you.
Once these steps are completed, you will be ready to complete and submit your F-1 student visa application. 
1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US government’s way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education. 
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay. 
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials. 
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., like getting a US driver’s license). 
Helpful resources: Confirm your US university is a SEVP-accredited institution 
Keep your Shorelight enrollment advisor updated through every step of the visa process – when you submit your application, schedule your visa interview, and, of course, when your visa application is approved.
2. Pay Your SEVIS Fee
The total cost for your F-1 student visa will be approximately $510, which includes the cost of the visa itself, plus SEVIS processing and maintenance fees. 
Requirements: Your I-20
Cost: $350 
Where to apply: Payment portal for your SEVIS fee
Make sure to save the I-901 SEVIS fee receipt. You will need it for your visa interview. 
3. Complete Your DS-160 Visa Application
Your DS-160 is your visa application. All prospective international students must complete a DS-160 to receive an F-1 visa. 
Requirements: Your I-20, passport, travel itinerary, photo for your visa
Cost: $160 
Where to apply: Application portal for your DS-160
After you successfully submit your DS-160, you will receive a printed confirmation with a barcode on it. Save this form – you will need it for your visa interview. 
4. Schedule Your Visa Interview
Find the nearest US embassy or consulate and schedule your visa interview. Wait times will vary by country and can take months — so remember to set up your appointments as early as possible!
If you are enrolling at a US university through Shorelight, ask your enrollment advisor about student visa interview tips or how to set up a mock interview session. Practicing your visa interview in advance will make you feel more comfortable with the process.
Ask your Shorelight advisor to set up a mock visa interview for you.
5. Attend Your Visa Interview
During the interview portion of the F-1 visa application process, the US consulate or embassy confirms you are coming to study as a legitimate, serious student. In your visa interview, you must also prove you have the funds to cover your time studying in the US, and confirm that you plan on returning home after your studies are complete. Attending your visa interview in person is required, though there are a few rare exceptions (e.g., if you are younger than 14 or older than 80 years of age, or if you meet certain visa renewal requirements). 
Cost: Your DS-160 payment covers the cost
Where to apply: Scheduling portal for your visa interview
After you successfully complete your visa interview, you will be granted your F-1 visa and acquire F-1 status. You are now cleared to study in the USA! 
Refer to Travel.state.gov to learn more. If you need any help with preparing or submitting your application, Shorelight provides application assistance for international students.
Before you attend your visa interview, make sure to have the following documents ready for evaluation by the consular officer:
A valid passport
A copy of the photo you will use for your visa
Printed copies of your DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmations
I-20 form
School transcript and official test scores cited on your university application
Diploma (if applicable)
Bank statements or other proof of finances
During your interview, the consular officer may request additional documents. To prepare, consider bringing the following documents:
Academic records such as transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates from schools you attended
Standardized test scores required by your US institution
Evidence of your intent to depart the United States upon completion of your course of study
Statements proving your ability to pay all educational, living, and travel costs
As an international student, you might feel uncertain about your upcoming interview. While feeling nervous is normal, do not forget to take a deep breath and remember that you are well prepared! Your interview is important, but should not be stressful.
Your interviewer will ask questions to determine: 
Are you a legitimate student?
Do you have the resources to pay for your studies?
Do you plan to return home after completing your degree?
To prepare for your F-1 student visa interview, here are some questions you might be asked: 
Why did you pick this university?
Which other US universities did you apply to?
How will you pay for your education?
Do you have relatives in the USA?
Do you plan to work while in the USA?
What do you plan to do after graduation?
Your Shorelight advisor can help you prepare for your interview by giving you a detailed overview of what the process will involve. They can also help you practice with mock interviews! Shorelight’s F-1 student visa interview guide can also help you learn more about what you can do to prepare for your upcoming interview. 
There is a possibility that your F-1 visa application will be denied. If this happens, you will be given detailed reasoning in writing, including the section of the law that led to the denial of your application.  
To avoid having your F-1 student visa application denied, it is important to read and follow all instructions carefully. Always double- and triple-check your documents before submitting your application. Shorelight advisors can offer visa assistance to make this process easier for you: They are happy to help you organize all the documents you will need, in the correct formats, and on schedule. 
Remember: During your F-1 student visa interview, you want to sufficiently demonstrate that you are traveling to the US to study and planning to return to your home country once your program is complete. Keep this in mind as you answer your interview questions.
As an international student, you must actively maintain your F-1 status to continue studying in the US. To do this, you must comply with both university regulations and codes of conduct, as well as with the requirements and conditions set out in your F-1 visa requirements. 
When entering the US:
Make sure to enter the US no more than 30 days before your program begins.
As soon as you arrive in the country, contact your designated school official (DSO).
When you arrive at your university, contact your DSO again before the start date listed on your I-20 form.
While studying in the US:
Attend all your classes and maintain good academic standing. If you require support with any of your classes, your Shorelight advisor can direct you to academic resources to help you improve.
If you need extra time to complete your program which would exceed the end date specified in your I-20, speak with your DSO to discuss your options for possible extensions.
Make sure to enroll for a full course of study when your academic term is in session.
If you want to drop a class or change classes, make sure to speak to your DSO first.
If you want to take a break and/or go on vacation, remember to first complete at least one full academic year at your institution.  After your holiday, you must also register for classes in the next academic term.
Yes, you will be able to work in the US on a F-1 student visa. However, you will have to follow certain F-1 visa rules and restrictions:
You can only work part time on campus while your academic term is in session
You can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week
You may be able to work off campus with the approval of your university
During academic breaks, you will be permitted to work full time, if your university allows it. You can learn more about working as a F-1 international student by referring to USCIS.gov.
When searching for work while you study, make sure to seek approval from your DSO first. 
Keep in mind, once you finish your program, you will have a grace period of 60 days to leave the US. If you wish to extend your stay, you can speak to a Shorelight advisor to explore your options, such as transferring to another school or pursuing further education. You can also refer to Shorelight’s F-1 extension guide to have a look at your options.
Now that you know how US non-immigrant visas work for international students, create a checklist of next steps and get started. The sooner you begin fulfilling the USA study visa requirements, the better chance you will have of securing your spot at an American university.

(3) General requirements. (i) Every nonimmigrant alien who applies for admission to, or an extension of stay in, the United States, must establish that he or she is admissible to the United States, or that any ground of inadmissibility has been waived under section 212(d)(3) of the Act. Upon application for admission, the alien must present a valid passport and valid visa unless either or both documents have been waived. A nonimmigrant alien's admission to the United States is conditioned on compliance with any inspection requirement in §235.1(d) or of this chapter. The passport of an alien applying for admission must be valid for a minimum of six months from the expiration date of the contemplated period of stay, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, and the alien must agree to abide by the terms and conditions of his or her admission. An alien applying for extension of stay must present a passport only if requested to do so by the Department of Homeland Security. The passport of an alien applying for extension of stay must be valid at the time of application for extension, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, and the alien must agree to maintain the validity of his or her passport and to abide by all the terms and conditions of his extension.
(ii) At the time of admission or extension of stay, every nonimmigrant alien must also agree to depart the United States at the expiration of his or her authorized period of admission or extension of stay, or upon abandonment of his or her authorized nonimmigrant status, and to comply with the departure procedures at section 215.8 of this chapter if such procedures apply to the particular alien. The nonimmigrant alien's failure to comply with those departure requirements, including any requirement that the alien provide biometric identifiers, may constitute a failure of the alien to maintain the terms of his or her nonimmigrant status.
(iii) At the time a nonimmigrant alien applies for admission or extension of stay, he or she must post a bond on Form I-352 in the sum of not less than $500, to ensure the maintenance of his or her nonimmigrant status and departure from the United States, if required to do so by the Commissioner of CBP, the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an immigration judge, or the Board of Immigration Appeals.
(b) Readmission of nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15) (F), (J), (M), or (Q)(ii) to complete unexpired periods of previous admission or extension of stay—(1) Section 101(a)(15)(F). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for duration of status as defined in §214.2(f)(5)(iii), any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(F) of the Act, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United States not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory or adjacent islands;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the requirement for presentation of a passport; and
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, an Arrival-Departure Record, Form I-94 (see §1.4), issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay, the alien's Form I-20 ID copy, and either:
(A) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20A-B if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20A since the form was initially issued; or
(B) A new Form I-20A-B if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20A since the form was initially issued.
(2) Section 101(a)(15)(J). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's departure, any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United States not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory or adjacent islands;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the requirement for the presentation of a passport; and
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, Form I-94 issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay or copy three of the last Form IAP-66 issued to the alien. Form I-94 or Form IAP-66 must show the unexpired period of the alien's stay endorsed by the Service.
(3) Section 101(a)(15)(M). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's departure, any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(M) of the Act, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the requirement for presentation of a passport; and
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, Form I-94 issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay, the alien's Form I-20 ID copy, and a properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N.
(4) Section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's departure, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United States not exceeding 30 days solely in contiguous territory or adjacent islands;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport;
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, an Arrival-Departure Record, Form I-94, issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay. The principal alien must also present a Certification Letter issued by the Department of State's Program Administrator.
(c) Extensions of stay—(1) Filing on Form I-129. An employer seeking the services of an E-1, E-2, H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, H-3, L-1, O-1, O-2, P-1, P-2, P-3, Q-1, R-1, or TN nonimmigrant beyond the period previously granted, must petition for an extension of stay on Form I-129. The petition must be filed with the fee required in §103.7 of this chapter, and the initial evidence specified in §214.2, and on the petition form. Dependents holding derivative status may be included in the petition if it is for only one worker and the form version specifically provides for their inclusion. In all other cases dependents of the worker should file on Form I-539.
(2) Filing on Form I-539. Any other nonimmigrant alien, except an alien in F or J status who has been granted duration of status, who seeks to extend his or her stay beyond the currently authorized period of admission, must apply for an extension of stay on Form I-539 with the fee required in §103.7 of this chapter together with any initial evidence specified in the applicable provisions of §214.2, and on the application form. More than one person may be included in an application where the co-applicants are all members of a single family group and either all hold the same nonimmigrant status or one holds a nonimmigrant status and the other co-applicants are his or her spouse and/or children who hold derivative nonimmigrant status based on his or her status. Extensions granted to members of a family group must be for the same period of time. The shortest period granted to any member of the family shall be granted to all members of the family. In order to be eligible for an extension of stay, nonimmigrant aliens in K-3/K-4 status must do so in accordance with §214.2(k)(10).
(3) Ineligible for extension of stay. A nonimmigrant in any of the following classes is ineligible for an extension of stay:
(i) B-1 or B-2 where admission was pursuant to the Visa Waiver Pilot Program;
(ii) C-1, C-2, C-3;
(iii) D-1, D-2;
(iv) K-1, K-2;
(v) Any nonimmigrant admitted for duration of status, other than as provided in §214.2(f)(7);
(vi) Any nonimmigrant who is classified pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act beyond a total of 3 years; or
(vii) Any nonimmigrant who is classified according to section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii) of the Act beyond a total of 3 years.
(viii) Any nonimmigrant admitted pursuant to the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program, as provided in section 212(l) of the Act.
(4) Timely filing and maintenance of status. An extension of stay may not be approved for an applicant who failed to maintain the previously accorded status or where such status expired before the application or petition was filed, except that failure to file before the period of previously authorized status expired may be excused in the discretion of the Service and without separate application, with any extension granted from the date the previously authorized stay expired, where it is demonstrated at the time of filing that:
(i) The delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the applicant or petitioner, and the Service finds the delay commensurate with the circumstances;
(ii) The alien has not otherwise violated his or her nonimmigrant status;
(iii) The alien remains a bona fide nonimmigrant; and
(iv) The alien is not the subject of deportation proceedings under section 242 of the Act (prior to April 1, 1997) or removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act.
(5) Decision in Form I-129 or I-539 extension proceedings. Where an applicant or petitioner demonstrates eligibility for a requested extension, it may be granted at the discretion of the Service. There is no appeal from the denial of an application for extension of stay filed on Form I-129 or I-539.
(d) Termination of status. Within the period of initial admission or extension of stay, the nonimmigrant status of an alien shall be terminated by the revocation of a waiver authorized on his or her behalf under section 212(d) (3) or (4) of the Act; by the introduction of a private bill to confer permanent resident status on such alien; or, pursuant to notification in the Federal Register, on the basis of national security, diplomatic, or public safety reasons.
(e) Employment. A nonimmigrant in the United States in a class defined in section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Act as a temporary visitor for pleasure, or section 101(a)(15)(C) of the Act as an alien in transit through this country, may not engage in any employment. Any other nonimmigrant in the United States may not engage in any employment unless he has been accorded a nonimmigrant classification which authorizes employment or he has been granted permission to engage in employment in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. A nonimmigrant who is permitted to engage in employment may engage only in such employment as has been authorized. Any unauthorized employment by a nonimmigrant constitutes a failure to maintain status within the meaning of section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
(f) Registration and false information. A nonimmigrant's admission and continued stay in the United States is conditioned on compliance with any registration, photographing, and fingerprinting requirements under §264.1(f) of this chapter that relate to the maintenance of nonimmigrant status and also on the full and truthful disclosure of all information requested by the Service. Willful failure by a nonimmigrant to register or to provide full and truthful information requested by the Service (regardless of whether or not the information requested was material) constitutes a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status under section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)).
(g) Criminal activity. A condition of a nonimmigrant's admission and continued stay in the United States is obedience to all laws of United States jurisdictions which prohibit the commission of crimes of violence and for which a sentence of more than one year imprisonment may be imposed. A nonimmigrant's conviction in a jurisdiction in the United States for a crime of violence for which a sentence of more than one year imprisonment may be imposed (regardless of whether such sentence is in fact imposed) constitutes a failure to maintain status under section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
(h) Education privacy and F, J, and M nonimmigrants. As authorized by section 641(c)(2) of Division C of Pub. L. 104-208, 8 U.S.C. 1372, and §2.1(a) of this chapter, the Service has determined that, with respect to F and M nonimmigrant students and J nonimmigrant exchange visitors, waiving the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. 1232g, is necessary for the proper implementation of 8 U.S.C. 1372. An educational agency or institution may not refuse to report information concerning an F or M nonimmigrant student or a J nonimmigrant exchange visitor that the educational agency or institution is required to report under 8 U.S.C. 1372 and §214.3(g) (or any corresponding Department of State regulation concerning J nonimmigrants) on the basis of FERPA and any regulation implementing FERPA. The waiver of FERPA under this paragraph authorizes and requires an educational agency or institution to report information concerning an F, J or M nonimmigrant that would ordinarily be protected by FERPA, but only to the extent that 8 U.S.C. 1372 and §214.3(g) (or any corresponding Department of State regulation concerning J nonimmigrants) requires the educational agency or institution to report information.
(i) Employment in a health care occupation. (1) Except as provided in 8 CFR 212.15(n), any alien described in 8 CFR 212.15(a) who is coming to the United States to perform labor in a health care occupation described in 8 CFR 212.15(c) must obtain a certificate from a credentialing organization described in 8 CFR 212.15(e). The certificate or certified statement must be presented to the Department of Homeland Security in accordance with 8 CFR 212.15(d). In the alternative, an eligible alien seeking admission as a nurse may obtain a certified statement as provided in 8 CFR 212.15(h).
(2) A TN nonimmigrant may establish that he or she is eligible for a waiver described at 8 CFR 212.15(n) by providing evidence that his or her initial admission as a TN (or TC) nonimmigrant health care worker occurred before September 23, 2003, and he or she was licensed and employed in the United States as a health care worker before September 23, 2003. Evidence may include, but is not limited to, copies of TN or TC approval notices, copies of Form I-94 Arrival/Departure Records, employment verification letters and/or pay-stubs or other employment records, and state health care worker licenses.
(j) Extension of stay or change of status for health care worker. In the case of any alien admitted temporarily as a nonimmigrant under section 212(d)(3) of the Act and 8 CFR 212.15(n) for the primary purpose of the providing labor in a health care occupation described in 8 CFR 212.15(c), the petitioning employer may file a Form I-129 to extend the approval period for the alien's classification for the nonimmigrant status. If the alien is in the United States and is eligible for an extension of stay or change of status, the Form I-129 also serves as an application to extend the period of the alien's authorized stay or to change the alien's status. Although the Form I-129 petition may be approved, as it relates to the employer's request to classify the alien, the application for an extension of stay or change of status shall be denied if:
(1) The petitioner or applicant fails to submit the certification required by 8 CFR 212.15(a) with the petition or application to extend the alien's stay or change the alien's status; or
(2) The petition or application to extend the alien's stay or change the alien's status does include the certification required by 8 CFR 212.15(a), but the alien obtained the certification more than 1 year after the date of the alien's admission under section 212(d)(3) of the Act and 8 CFR 212.15(n). While DHS may admit, extend the period of authorized stay, or change the status of a nonimmigrant health care worker for a period of 1 year if the alien does not have certification on or before July 26, 2004 (or on or before July 26, 2005, in the case of a citizen of Canada or Mexico, who, before September 23, 2003, was employed as a TN or TC nonimmigrant health care worker and held a valid license from a U.S. jurisdiction), the alien will not be eligible for a subsequent admission, change of status, or extension of stay as a health care worker if the alien has not obtained the requisite certification 1 year after the initial date of admission, change of status, or extension of stay as a health care worker.
(k) Denial of petitions under section 214(c) of the Act based on a finding by the Department of Labor. Upon debarment by the Department of Labor pursuant to 20 CFR part 655, USCIS may deny any petition filed by that petitioner for nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(H) (except for status under sections 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1)), (L), (O), and (P)(i) of the Act) for a period of at least 1 year but not more than 5 years. The length of the period shall be based on the severity of the violation or violations. The decision to deny petitions, the time period for the bar to petitions, and the reasons for the time period will be explained in a written notice to the petitioner.

(f) Students in colleges, universities, seminaries, conservatories, academic high schools, elementary schools, other academic institutions, and in language training programs—(1) Admission of student—(i) Eligibility for admission. A nonimmigrant student may be admitted into the United States in nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(F) of the Act, if:
(A) The student presents a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in his or her own name by a school approved by the Service for attendance by F-1 foreign students. (In the alternative, for a student seeking admission prior to August 1, 2003, the student may present a currently-valid Form I-20A-B/I-20ID, if that form was issued by the school prior to January 30, 2003);
(B) The student has documentary evidence of financial support in the amount indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20A-B/I-20ID);
(C) For students seeking initial admission only, the student intends to attend the school specified in the student's visa (or, where the student is exempt from the requirement for a visa, the school indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20A-B/I-20ID)); and
(D) In the case of a student who intends to study at a public secondary school, the student has demonstrated that he or she has reimbursed the local educational agency that administers the school for the full, unsubsidized per capita cost of providing education at the school for the period of the student's attendance.
(ii) Disposition of Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID. Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID contains two copies, the I-20 School Copy and the I-20 ID (Student) Copy. For purposes of clarity, the entire Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID shall be referred to as Form I-20 A-B and the I-20 ID (Student) Copy shall be referred to as the I-20 ID. When an F-1 student applies for admission with a complete Form I-20 A-B, the inspecting officer shall:
(A) Transcribe the student's admission number from Form I-94 onto his or her Form I-20 A-B (for students seeking initial admission only);
(B) Endorse all copies of the Form I-20 A-B;
(C) Return the I-20 ID to the student; and
(D) Forward the I-20 School Copy to the Service's processing center for data entry. (The school copy of Form I-20 A-B will be sent back to the school as a notice of the student's admission after data entry.)
(iii) Use of SEVIS. On January 30, 2003, the use of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) will become mandatory for the issuance of any new Form I-20. A student or dependent who presents a non-SEVIS Form I-20 issued on or after January 30, 2003, will not be accepted for admission to the United States. Non-SEVIS Forms I-20 issued prior to January 30, 2003, will continue to be acceptable until August 1, 2003. However, schools must issue a SEVIS Form I-20 to any current student requiring a reportable action (e.g., extension of status, practical training, and requests for employment authorization) or a new Form I-20, or for any aliens who must obtain a new nonimmigrant student visa. As of August 1, 2003, the records of all current or continuing students must be entered in SEVIS.
(2) I-20 ID. An F-1 student is expected to safekeep the initial I-20 ID bearing the admission number and any subsequent copies which have been issued to him or her. Should the student lose his or her current I-20 ID, a replacement copy bearing the same information as the lost copy, including any endorsement for employment and notations, may be issued by the designated school official (DSO) as defined in 8 CFR 214.3(l)(1)(i).
(3) Admission of the spouse and minor children of an F-1 student. The spouse and minor children accompanying an F-1 student are eligible for admission in F-2 status if the student is admitted in F-1 status. The spouse and minor children following-to-join an F-1 student are eligible for admission to the United States in F-2 status if they are able to demonstrate that the F-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study, or engaged in approved practical training following completion of studies. In either case, at the time they seek admission, the eligible spouse and minor children of an F-1 student with a SEVIS Form I-20 must individually present an original SEVIS Form I-20 issued in the name of each F-2 dependent issued by a school authorized by the Service for attendance by F-1 foreign students. Prior to August 1, 2003, if exigent circumstances are demonstrated, the Service will allow the dependent of an F-1 student in possession of a SEVIS Form I-20 to enter the United States using a copy of the F-1 student's SEVIS Form I-20. (In the alternative, for dependents seeking admission to the United States prior to August 1, 2003, a copy of the F-1 student's current Form I-20ID issued prior to January 30, 2003, with proper endorsement by the DSO will satisfy this requirement.) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or Form I-20A-B) is required for a dependent where there has been any substantive change in the F-1 student's current information.
(4) Temporary absence. An F-1 student returning to the United States from a temporary absence of five months or less may be readmitted for attendance at a Service-approved educational institution, if the student presents:
(i) A current SEVIS Form I-20 (or, for readmission prior to August 1, 2003, a current Form I-20ID which was issued prior to January 30, 2003), properly endorsed by the DSO for reentry if there has been no substantive change to the most recent Form I-20 information; or
(ii) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or, for readmission prior to August 1, 2003, a new Form I-20ID which was issued prior to January 30, 2003), if there has been a substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20 information, such as in the case of a student who has changed the major area of study, who intends to transfer to another Service approved institution or who has advanced to a higher level of study.
(5) Duration of status—(i) General. Except for border commuter students covered by the provisions of paragraph (f)(18) of this section, an F-1 student is admitted for duration of status. Duration of status is defined as the time during which an F-1 student is pursuing a full course of study at an educational institution approved by the Service for attendance by foreign students, or engaging in authorized practical training following completion of studies, except that an F-1 student who is admitted to attend a public high school is restricted to an aggregate of 12 months of study at any public high school(s). An F-1 student may be admitted for a period up to 30 days before the indicated report date or program start date listed on Form I-20. The student is considered to be maintaining status if he or she is making normal progress toward completing a course of study.

(ii) Change in educational levels. An F-1 student who continues from one educational level to another is considered to be maintaining status, provided that the transition to the new educational level is accomplished according to transfer procedures outlined in paragraph (f)(8) of this section.
(iii) Annual vacation. An F-1 student at an academic institution is considered to be in status during the annual (or summer) vacation if the student is eligible and intends to register for the next term. A student attending a school on a quarter or trimester calendar who takes only one vacation a year during any one of the quarters or trimesters instead of during the summer is considered to be in status during that vacation, if the student has completed the equivalent of an academic year prior to taking the vacation.
(iv) Preparation for departure. An F-1 student who has completed a course of study and any authorized practical training following completion of studies will be allowed an additional 60-day period to prepare for departure from the United States or to transfer in accordance with paragraph (f)(8) of this section. An F-1 student authorized by the DSO to withdraw from classes will be allowed a 15-day period for departure from the United States. However, an F-1 student who fails to maintain a full course of study without the approval of the DSO or otherwise fails to maintain status is not eligible for an additional period for departure.
(v) Emergent circumstances as determined by the Commissioner. Where the Commissioner has suspended the applicability of any or all of the requirements for on-campus or off-campus employment authorization for specified students pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9)(i) or (f)(9)(ii) of this section by notice in the Federal Register, an affected student who needs to reduce his or her full course of study as a result of accepting employment authorized by such notice in the Federal Register will be considered to be in status during the authorized employment, subject to any other conditions specified in the notice, provided that, for the duration of the authorized employment, the student is registered for the number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term specified in the notice, which in no event shall be less than 6 semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term if the student is at the undergraduate level or less than 3 semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term if the student is at the graduate level, and is continuing to make progress toward completing the course of study.
(vi) Extension of duration of status and grant of employment authorization.
(A) The duration of status, and any employment authorization granted under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B) and (C), of an F-1 student who is the beneficiary of an H-1B petition and request for change of status shall be automatically extended until October 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1B visa is being requested where such petition:
(1) Has been timely filed; and
(2) States that the employment start date for the F-1 student is October 1 of the following fiscal year.
(B) The automatic extension of an F-1 student's duration of status and employment authorization under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section shall immediately terminate upon the rejection, denial, or revocation of the H-1B petition filed on such F-1 student's behalf.
(C) In order to obtain the automatic extension of stay and employment authorization under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, the F-1 student, according to 8 CFR part 248, must not have violated the terms or conditions of his or her nonimmigrant status.
(D) An automatic extension of an F-1 student's duration of status under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section also applies to the duration of status of any F-2 dependent aliens.

(6) Full course of study—(i) General. Successful completion of the full course of study must lead to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective. A course of study at an institution not approved for attendance by foreign students as provided in §214.3(a)(3) does not satisfy this requirement. A “full course of study” as required by section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act means:
(A) Postgraduate study or postdoctoral study at a college or university, or undergraduate or postgraduate study at a conservatory or religious seminary, certified by a DSO as a full course of study;
(B) Undergraduate study at a college or university, certified by a school official to consist of at least twelve semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter hour systems, where all undergraduate students who are enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or are considered full-time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the district director in the school approval process), except when the student needs a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term;
(C) Study in a postsecondary language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other non-vocational program at a school which confers upon its graduates recognized associate or other degrees or has established that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning which are either: (1) A school (or school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof; or (2) a school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; and which has been certified by a designated school official to consist of at least twelve clock hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by the district director in the school approval process;
(D) Study in any other language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other nonvocational training program, certified by a designated school official to consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or to consist of at least twenty-two clock hours a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of laboratory work; or
(E) Study in a curriculum at an approved private elementary or middle school or public or private academic high school which is certified by a designated school official to consist of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress toward graduation.
(F) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) and (f)(6)(i)(B) of this section, an alien who has been granted employment authorization pursuant to the terms of a document issued by the Commissioner under paragraphs (f)(9)(i) or (f)(9)(ii) of this section and published in the Federal Register shall be deemed to be engaged in a “full course of study” if he or she remains registered for no less than the number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term specified by the Commissioner in the notice for the validity period of such employment authorization.

(G) For F-1 students enrolled in classes for credit or classroom hours, no more than the equivalent of one class or three credits per session, term, semester, trimester, or quarter may be counted toward the full course of study requirement if the class is taken on-line or through distance education and does not require the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to completion of the class. An on-line or distance education course is a course that is offered principally through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing. If the F-1 student's course of study is in a language study program, no on-line or distance education classes may be considered to count toward a student's full course of study requirement.
(H) On-campus employment pursuant to the terms of a scholarship, fellowship, or assistantship is deemed to be part of the academic program of a student otherwise taking a full course of study.
(ii) Institution of higher learning. For purposes of this paragraph, a college or university is an institution of higher learning which awards recognized associate, bachelor's, master's, doctorate, or professional degrees. Schools which devote themselves exclusively or primarily to vocational, business, or language instruction are not included in the category of colleges or universities. Vocational or business schools which are classifiable as M-1 schools are provided for by regulations under 8 CFR 214.2(m).
(iii) Reduced course load. The designated school official may allow an F-1 student to engage in less than a full course of study as provided in this paragraph (f)(6)(iii). Except as otherwise noted, a reduced course load must consist of at least six semester or quarter hours, or half the clock hours required for a full course of study. A student who drops below a full course of study without the prior approval of the DSO will be considered out of status. On-campus employment pursuant to the terms of a scholarship, fellowship, or assistantship is deemed to be part of the academic program of a student otherwise taking a full course of study.
(A) Academic difficulties. The DSO may authorize a reduced course load on account of a student's initial difficulty with the English language or reading requirements, unfamiliarity with U.S. teaching methods, or improper course level placement. The student must resume a full course of study at the next available term, session, or semester, excluding a summer session, in order to maintain student status. A student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to academic difficulties is not eligible for a second authorization by the DSO due to academic difficulties while pursuing a course of study at that program level. A student authorized to drop below a full course of study for academic difficulties while pursuing a course of study at a particular program level may still be authorized for a reduced course load due to an illness medical condition as provided for in paragraph (B) of this section.
(B) Medical conditions. The DSO may authorize a reduced course load (or, if necessary, no course load) due to a student's temporary illness or medical condition for a period of time not to exceed an aggregate of 12 months while the student is pursuing a course of study at a particular program level. In order to authorize a reduced course load based upon a medical condition, the student must provide medical documentation from a licensed medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or licensed clinical psychologist, to the DSO to substantiate the illness or medical condition. The student must provide current medical documentation and the DSO must reauthorize the drop below full course of study each new term, session, or semester. A student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to illness or medical condition for an aggregate of 12 months may not be authorized by a DSO to reduce his or her course load on subsequent occasions while pursuing a course of study at the same program level. A student may be authorized to reduce course load for a reason of illness or medical condition on more than one occasion while pursuing a course of study, so long as the aggregate period of that authorization does not exceed 12 months.
(C) Completion of course of study. The DSO may authorize a reduced course load in the student's final term, semester, or session if fewer courses are needed to complete the course of study. If the student is not required to take any additional courses to satisfy the requirements for completion, but continues to be enrolled for administrative purposes, the student is considered to have completed the course of study and must take action to maintain status. Such action may include application for change of status or departure from the U.S.
(D) Reporting requirements for non-SEVIS schools. A DSO must report to the Service any student who is authorized to reduce his or her course load. Within 21 days of the authorization, the DSO must send a photocopy of the student's current Form I-20ID along with Form I-538 to Service's data processing center indicating the date and reason that the student was authorized to drop below full time status. Similarly, the DSO will report to the Service no more than 21 days after the student has resumed a full course of study by submitting a current copy of the students' Form I-20ID to the Service's data processing center indicating the date a full course of study was resumed and the new program end date with Form I-538, if applicable.
(E) SEVIS reporting requirements. In order for a student to be authorized to drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS prior to the student reducing his or her course load. The DSO must update SEVIS with the date, reason for authorization, and the start date of the next term or session. The DSO must also notify SEVIS within 21 days of the student's commencement of a full course of study. If an extension of the program end date is required due to the drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS by completing a new SEVIS Form I-20 with the new program end date in accordance with paragraph (f)(7) of this section.

(iv) Concurrent enrollment. An F-1 student may be enrolled in two different Service-approved schools at one time as long as the combined enrollment amounts to a full time course of study. In cases where a student is concurrently enrolled, the school from which the student will earn his or her degree or certification should issue the Form I-20, and conduct subsequent certifications and updates to the Form I-20. The DSO from this school is also responsible for all of the reporting requirements to the Service. In instances where a student is enrolled in programs with different full course of study requirements (e.g., clock hours vs. credit hours), the DSO is permitted to determine what constitutes a full time course of study.
(7) Extension of stay—(i) General. An F-1 student who is admitted for duration of status is not required to apply for extension of stay as long as the student is maintaining status and making normal progress toward completion of his or her educational objective. An F-1 student who is currently maintaining status and making normal progress toward completing his or her educational objective, but who is unable to complete his or her course of study by the program end date on the Form I-20, must apply prior to the program end date for a program extension pursuant to paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section.
(ii) Report date and program completion date on Form I-20. When determining the report date on the Form I-20, the DSO may choose a reasonable date to accommodate a student's need to be in attendance for required activities at the school prior to the actual start of classes. Such required activities may include, but are not limited to, research projects and orientation sessions. However, for purposes of employment, the DSO may not indicate a report date more than 30 days prior to the start of classes. When determining the program completion date on Form I-20, the DSO should make a reasonable estimate based upon the time an average student would need to complete a similar program in the same discipline.
(iii) Program extension for students in lawful status. An F-1 student who is unable to meet the program completion date on the Form I-20 may be granted an extension by the DSO if the DSO certifies that the student has continually maintained status and that the delays are caused by compelling academic or medical reasons, such as changes of major or research topics, unexpected research problems, or documented illnesses. Delays caused by academic probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program extensions. A DSO may not grant an extension if the student did not apply for an extension until after the program end date noted on the Form I-20. An F-1 student who is unable to complete the educational program within the time listed on Form I-20 and who is ineligible for program extension pursuant to this paragraph (f)(7) is considered out of status. If eligible, the student may apply for reinstatement under the provisions of paragraph (f)(16) of this section.
(iv) Notification. Upon granting a program extension, a DSO at a non-SEVIS school must immediately submit notification to the Service's data processing center using Form I-538 and the top page of Form I-20A-B showing the new program completion date. For a school enrolled in SEVIS, a DSO may grant a program extension only by updating SEVIS and issuing a new Form I-20 reflecting the current program end date. A DSO may grant an extension any time prior to the program end date listed on the student's original Form I-20.

(8) School transfer. (i) A student who is maintaining status may transfer to another Service approved school by following the notification procedure prescribed in paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section. However, an F-1 student is not permitted to remain in the United States when transferring between schools or programs unless the student will begin classes at the transfer school or program within 5 months of transferring out of the current school or within 5 months of the program completion date on his or her current Form I-20, whichever is earlier. In the case of an F-1 student authorized to engage in post-completion optional practical training (OPT), the student must be able resume classes within 5 months of transferring out of the school that recommended OPT or the date the OPT authorization ends, whichever is earlier. An F-1 student who was not pursuing a full course of study at the school he or she was last authorized to attend is ineligible for school transfer and must apply for reinstatement under the provisions of paragraph (f)(16) of this section, or, in the alternative, may depart the country and return as an initial entry in a new F-1 nonimmigrant status.
(ii) Transfer procedure. To transfer schools, an F-1 student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a Form I-20 A-B, issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k), from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. The transfer will be effected only if the F-1 student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 A-B and returns the form to a designated school official on campus within 15 days of beginning attendance at the new school.
(A) Non-SEVIS School to Non-SEVIS school. To transfer from one non-SEVIS school to a different non-SEVIS school, the student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a Form I-20 issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k) from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Prior to issuance of any Form I-20, the DSO at the transfer school is responsible for determining that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school and is eligible for transfer to the new school. The transfer will be effected only if the student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 and returns the form to a DSO of the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on Form I-20. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 the DSO must note “transfer completed on (date)” in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance at the transfer school; return the Form I-20 to the student; submit the School copy of the Form I-20 to Service's Data Processing Center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and forward a photocopy of the school copy to the school from which the student transferred.
(B) Non-SEVIS school to SEVIS school. To transfer from a non-SEVIS school to a SEVIS school, the student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k) from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Prior to issuance of any Form I-20, the DSO at the transfer school is responsible for determining that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school and is eligible for transfer to the new school. Once the transfer school has issued the SEVIS Form I-20 to the student indicating a transfer, the transfer school becomes responsible for updating and maintaining the student's record in SEVIS. The student is then required to notify the DSO at the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on SEVIS Form I-20. Upon notification that the student is enrolled in classes, the DSO of the transfer school must update SEVIS to reflect the student's registration and current address, thereby acknowledging that the student has completed the transfer process. In the remarks section of the student's SEVIS Form I-20, the DSO must note that the transfer has been completed, including the date, and return the form to the student. The transfer is effected when the transfer school updates SEVIS indicating that the student has registered in classes within the 30 days required by §214.3(g)(3)(iii).
(C) SEVIS school to SEVIS school. To transfer from a SEVIS school to a SEVIS school the student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and must indicate the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school will update the student's record in SEVIS as a “transfer out” and indicate the school to which the student intends to transfer, and a release date. The release date will be the current semester or session completion date, or the date of expected transfer if earlier than the established academic cycle. The current school will retain control over the student's record in SEVIS until the student completes the current term or reaches the release date. At the request of the student, the DSO of the current school may cancel the transfer request at any time prior to the release date. As of the release date specified by the current DSO, the transfer school will be granted full access to the student's SEVIS record and then becomes responsible for that student. The current school conveys authority and responsibility over that student to the transfer school, and will no longer have full SEVIS access to that student's record. As such, a transfer request may not be cancelled by the current DSO after the release date has been reached. After the release date, the transfer DSO must complete the transfer of the student's record in SEVIS and may issue a SEVIS Form I-20. The student is then required to contact the DSO at the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on the SEVIS Form I-20. Upon notification that the student is enrolled in classes, the DSO of the transfer school must update SEVIS to reflect the student's registration and current address, thereby acknowledging that the student has completed the transfer process. In the remarks section of the student's SEVIS Form I-20, the DSO must note that the transfer has been completed, including the date, and return the form to the student. The transfer is effected when the transfer school notifies SEVIS that the student has enrolled in classes in accordance with the 30 days required by §214.3(g)(3)(iii).
(D) SEVIS school to non-SEVIS school. To transfer from a SEVIS school to a non-SEVIS school, the student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and must indicate the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school will update the student's status in SEVIS as “a transfer out”, enter a “release” or expected transfer date, and update the transfer school as “non-SEVIS.” The student must then notify the school to which the he or she intends to transfer of his or her intent to enroll. After the student has completed his or her current term or session, or has reached the expected transfer date, the DSO at the current school will no longer have full access to the student's SEVIS record. At this point, if the student has notified the transfer school of his or her intent to transfer, and the transfer school has determined that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school, the transfer school may issue the student a Form I-20. The transfer will be effected only if the student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 and returns the form to a designated school official of the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on Form I-20. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 the DSO must do as follows: note “transfer completed on (date)” in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance; return the Form I-20 to the student; submit the school copy of the Form I-20 to the Service's data processing center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and forward a photocopy of the school copy to the school from which the student transferred.
(iii) Notification. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 A-B, the DSO must:
(A) Note “transfer completed on (date)” on the student's I-20 ID in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance;
(B) Return the I-20 ID to the student;
(C) Submit the I-20 School copy to the Service's Data Processing Center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and
(D) Forward a photocopy of the Form I-20 A-B School Copy to the school from which the student transferred.
(9) Employment—(i) On-campus employment. On-campus employment must either be performed on the school's premises, (including on-location commercial firms which provide services for students on campus, such as the school bookstore or cafeteria), or at an off-campus location which is educationally affiliated with the school. Employment with on-site commercial firms, such as a construction company building a school building, which do not provide direct student services is not deemed on-campus employment for the purposes of this paragraph. In the case of off-campus locations, the educational affiliation must be associated with the school's established curriculum or related to contractually funded research projects at the post-graduate level. In any event, the employment must be an integral part of the student's educational program. Employment authorized under this paragraph must not exceed 20 hours a week while school is in session, unless the Commissioner suspends the applicability of this limitation due to emergent circumstances, as determined by the Commissioner, by means of notice in the Federal Register, the student demonstrates to the DSO that the employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship resulting from the emergent circumstances, and the DSO notates the Form I-20 in accordance with the Federal Register document. An F-1 student may, however, work on campus full-time when school is not in session or during the annual vacation. A student who has been issued a Form I-20 A-B to begin a new program in accordance with the provision of 8 CFR 214.3(k) and who intends to enroll for the next regular academic year, term, or session at the institution which issued the Form I-20 A-B may continue on-campus employment incident to status. Otherwise, an F-1 student may not engage in on-campus employment after completing a course of study, except employment for practical training as authorized under paragraph (f)(10) of this section. An F-I student may engage in any on-campus employment authorized under this paragraph which will not displace United States residents. In the case of a transfer in SEVIS, the student may only engage in on-campus employment at the school having jurisdiction over the student's SEVIS record. Upon initial entry to begin a new course of study, an F-1 student may not begin on-campus employment more than 30 days prior to the actual start of classes.
(ii) Off-campus work authorization—(A) General. An F-1 student may be authorized to work off-campus on a part-time basis in accordance with paragraph (f)(9)(ii) (B) or (C) of this section after having been in F-1 status for one full academic year provided that the student is in good academic standing as determined by the DSO. Part-time off-campus employment authorized under this section is limited to no more than twenty hours a week when school is in session. A student who is granted off-campus employment authorization may work full-time during holidays or school vacation. The employment authorization is automatically terminated whenever the student fails to maintain status. In emergent circumstances as determined by the Commissioner, the Commissioner may suspend the applicability of any or all of the requirements of paragraph (f)(9)(ii) of this section by notice in the Federal Register.
(B) [Reserved]
(C) Severe economic hardship. If other employment opportunities are not available or are otherwise insufficient, an eligible F-1 student may request off-campus employment work authorization based upon severe economic hardship caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the student's control. These circumstances may include loss of financial aid or on-campus employment without fault on the part of the student, substantial fluctuations in the value of currency or exchange rate, inordinate increases in tuition and/or living costs, unexpected changes in the financial condition of the student's source of support, medical bills, or other substantial and unexpected expenses.
(D) Procedure for off-campus employment authorization due to severe economic hardship. The student must request a recommendation from the DSO for off-campus employment. The DSO at a non-SEVIS school must make such a certification on Form I-538, Certification by Designated School Official. The DSO of a SEVIS school must complete such certification in SEVIS. The DSO may recommend the student for work off-campus for one year intervals by certifying that:
(1) The student has been in F-1 status for one full academic year;
(2) The student is in good standing as a student and is carrying a full course of study as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section;
(3) The student has demonstrated that acceptance of employment will not interfere with the student's carrying a full course of study; and
(4) The student has demonstrated that the employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the student's control pursuant to paragraph (f)(9)(ii)(C) of this section and has demonstrated that employment under paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section is unavailable or otherwise insufficient to meet the needs that have arisen as a result of the unforeseen circumstances.
(E) [Reserved]
(F) Severe economic hardship application. (1) The applicant should submit the economic hardship application for employment authorization on Form I-765, with the fee required by 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), to the service center having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. Applicants at a non-SEVIS school should submit Form I-20, Form I-538, and any other supporting materials such as affidavits which further detail the unforeseen circumstances that require the student to seek employment authorization and the unavailability or insufficiency of employment under paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section. Students enrolled in a SEVIS school should submit the SEVIS Form I-20 with the employment page demonstrating the DSO's comments and certification.
(2) The Service shall adjudicate the application for work authorization based upon severe economic hardship on the basis of Form I-20 ID, Form I-538, and Form I-765, and any additional supporting materials. If employment is authorized, the adjudicating officer shall issue an EAD. The Service director shall notify the student of the decision, and, if the application is denied, of the reason or reasons for the denial. No appeal shall lie from a decision to deny a request for employment authorization under this section. The employment authorization may be granted in one year intervals up to the expected date of completion of the student's current course of study. A student has permission to engage in off-campus employment only if the student receives the EAD endorsed to that effect. Off-campus employment authorization may be renewed by the Service only if the student is maintaining status and good academic standing. The employment authorization is automatically terminated whenever the student fails to maintain status.
(iii) Internship with an international organization. A bona fide F-1 student who has been offered employment by a recognized international organization within the meaning of the International Organization Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669) must apply for employment authorization to the service center having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. A student seeking employment authorization under this provision is required to present a written certification from the international organization that the proposed employment is within the scope of the organization's sponsorship, Form I-20 ID or SEVIS Form I-20 with employment page completed by DSO certifying eligibility for employment, and a completed Form I-765, with required fee as contained in §103.7(b)(1) of this chapter.
(10) Practical training. Practical training may be authorized to an F-1 student who has been lawfully enrolled on a full time basis, in a Service-approved college, university, conservatory, or seminary for one full academic year. This provision also includes students who, during their course of study, were enrolled in a study abroad program, if the student had spent at least one full academic term enrolled in a full course of study in the United States prior to studying abroad. A student may be authorized 12 months of practical training, and becomes eligible for another 12 months of practical training when he or she changes to a higher educational level. Students in English language training programs are ineligible for practical training. An eligible student may request employment authorization for practical training in a position that is directly related to his or her major area of study. There are two types of practical training available:
(i) Curricular practical training. An F-1 student may be authorized by the DSO to participate in a curricular practical training program that is an integral part of an established curriculum. Curricular practical training is defined to be alternative work/study, internship, cooperative education, or any other type of required internship or practicum that is offered by sponsoring employers through cooperative agreements with the school. Students who have received one year or more of full time curricular practical training are ineligible for post-completion academic training. Exceptions to the one academic year requirement are provided for students enrolled in graduate studies that require immediate participation in curricular practical training. A request for authorization for curricular practical training must be made to the DSO. A student may begin curricular practical training only after receiving his or her Form I-20 with the DSO endorsement.
(A) Non-SEVIS process. A student must request authorization for curricular practical training using Form I-538. Upon approving the request for authorization, the DSO shall: certify Form I-538 and send the form to the Service's data processing center; endorse the student's Form I-20 ID with “full-time (or part-time) curricular practical training authorized for (employer) at (location) from (date) to (date)”; and sign and date the Form I-20ID before returning it to the student.
(B) SEVIS process. To grant authorization for a student to engage in curricular practical training, a DSO at a SEVIS school will update the student's record in SEVIS as being authorized for curricular practical training that is directly related to the student's major area of study. The DSO will indicate whether the training is full-time or part-time, the employer and location, and the employment start and end date. The DSO will then print a copy of the employment page of the SEVIS Form I-20 indicating that curricular practical training has been approved. The DSO must sign, date, and return the SEVIS Form I-20 to the student prior to the student's commencement of employment.
(ii) Optional practical training.

(A) General. Consistent with the application and approval process in paragraph (f)(11) of this section, a student may apply to USCIS for authorization for temporary employment for optional practical training directly related to the student's major area of study. The student may not begin optional practical training until the date indicated on his or her employment authorization document, Form I-766. A student may be granted authorization to engage in temporary employment for optional practical training:
(1) During the student's annual vacation and at other times when school is not in session, if the student is currently enrolled, and is eligible for registration and intends to register for the next term or session;
(2) While school is in session, provided that practical training does not exceed 20 hours a week while school is in session; or
(3) After completion of the course of study, or, for a student in a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree program, after completion of all course requirements for the degree (excluding thesis or equivalent). Continued enrollment, for the school's administrative purposes, after all requirements for the degree have been met does not preclude eligibility for optional practical training. A student must complete all practical training within a 14-month period following the completion of study, except that a 24-month extension pursuant to paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section does not need to be completed within such 14-month period.
(B) Termination of practical training. Authorization to engage in optional practical training employment is automatically terminated when the student transfers to another school or begins study at another educational level.
(C) 24-month extension of post-completion OPT for a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) degree. Consistent with paragraph (f)(11)(i)(C) of this section, a qualified student may apply for an extension of OPT while in a valid period of post-completion OPT authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). An extension will be for 24 months for the first qualifying degree for which the student has completed all course requirements (excluding thesis or equivalent), including any qualifying degree as part of a dual degree program, subject to the requirement in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(3) of this section that previously obtained degrees must have been conferred. If a student completes all such course requirements for another qualifying degree at a higher degree level than the first, the student may apply for a second 24-month extension of OPT while in a valid period of post-completion OPT authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). In no event may a student be authorized for more than two lifetime STEM OPT extensions. A student who was granted a 17-month OPT extension under the rule issued at 73 FR 18944, whether or not such student requests an additional 7-month period of STEM OPT under 8 CFR 214.16, is considered to have been authorized for one STEM OPT extension, and may be eligible for only one more STEM OPT extension. Any subsequent application for an additional 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) must be based on a degree at a higher degree level than the degree that was the basis for the student's first OPT extension. In order to qualify for an extension of post-completion OPT based upon a STEM degree, all of the following requirements must be met.
(1) Accreditation. The degree that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension is from a U.S. educational institution accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education at the time of application.
(2) DHS-approved degree. The degree that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension is a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in a field determined by the Secretary, or his or her designee, to qualify within a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics field.
(i) The term “science, technology, engineering or mathematics field” means a field included in the Department of Education's Classification of Instructional Programs taxonomy within the two-digit series or successor series containing engineering, biological sciences, mathematics, and physical sciences, or a related field. In general, related fields will include fields involving research, innovation, or development of new technologies using engineering, mathematics, computer science, or natural sciences (including physical, biological, and agricultural sciences).
(ii) The Secretary, or his or her designee, will maintain the STEM Designated Degree Program List, which will be a complete list of qualifying degree program categories, published on the Student and Exchange Visitor Program Web site at http://www.ice.gov/sevis. Changes that are made to the Designated Degree Program List may also be published in a notice in the Federal Register. All program categories included on the list must be consistent with the definition set forth in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2)(i) of this section.
(iii) At the time the DSO recommends a 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) in SEVIS, the degree that is the basis for the application for the OPT extension must be contained within a category on the STEM Designated Degree Program List.
(3) Previously obtained STEM degree(s). The degree that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) may be, but is not required to be, the degree that is the basis for the post-completion OPT period authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). If an application for a 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) is based upon a degree obtained previous to the degree that provided the basis for the period of post-completion OPT authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B), that previously obtained degree must have been conferred from a U.S. educational institution that is accredited and SEVP-certified at the time the student's DSO recommends the student for the 24-month OPT extension and must be in a degree program category included on the current STEM Designated Degree Program List at the time of the DSO recommendation. That previously obtained degree must have been conferred within the 10 years preceding the date the DSO recommends the student for the 24-month OPT extension.
(4) Eligible practical training opportunity. The STEM practical training opportunity that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) must be directly related to the degree that qualifies the student for such extension, which may be the previously obtained degree described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(3) of this section.
(5) Employer qualification. The student's employer is enrolled in E-Verify, as evidenced by either a valid E-Verify Company Identification number or, if the employer is using an employer agent to create its E-Verify cases, a valid E-Verify Client Company Identification number, and the employer remains a participant in good standing with E-Verify, as determined by USCIS. An employer must also have an employer identification number (EIN) used for tax purposes.
(6) Employer reporting. A student may not be authorized for employment with an employer pursuant to paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section unless the employer agrees, by signing the Training Plan for STEM OPT Students, Form I-983 or successor form, to report the termination or departure of an OPT student to the DSO at the student's school, if the termination or departure is prior to the end of the authorized period of OPT. Such reporting must be made within five business days of the termination or departure. An employer shall consider a student to have departed when the employer knows the student has left the practical training opportunity, or if the student has not reported for his or her practical training for a period of five consecutive business days without the consent of the employer, whichever occurs earlier.
(7) Training Plan for STEM OPT Students, Form I-983 or successor form. (i) A student must fully complete an individualized Form I-983 or successor form and obtain requisite signatures from an appropriate individual in the employer's organization on the form, consistent with form instructions, before the DSO may recommend a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section in SEVIS. A student must submit the Form I-983 or successor form, which includes a certification of adherence to the training plan completed by an appropriate individual in the employer's organization who has signatory authority for the employer, to the student's DSO, prior to the new DSO recommendation. A student must present his or her signed and completed Form I-983 or successor form to a DSO at the educational institution of his or her most recent enrollment. A student, while in F-1 student status, may also be required to submit the Form I-983 or successor form to ICE and/or USCIS upon request or in accordance with form instructions.
(ii) The training plan described in the Form I-983 or successor form must identify goals for the STEM practical training opportunity, including specific knowledge, skills, or techniques that will be imparted to the student, and explain how those goals will be achieved through the work-based learning opportunity with the employer; describe a performance evaluation process; and describe methods of oversight and supervision. Employers may rely on their otherwise existing training programs or policies to satisfy the requirements relating to performance evaluation and oversight and supervision, as applicable.
(iii) The training plan described in the Form I-983 or successor form must explain how the training is directly related to the student's qualifying STEM degree.
(iv) If a student initiates a new practical training opportunity with a new employer during his or her 24-month OPT extension, the student must submit, within 10 days of beginning the new practical training opportunity, a new Form I-983 or successor form to the student's DSO, and subsequently obtain a new DSO recommendation.
(8) Duties, hours, and compensation for training. The terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity during the period of the 24-month OPT extension, including duties, hours, and compensation, must be commensurate with terms and conditions applicable to the employer's similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment. A student may not engage in practical training for less than 20 hours per week, excluding time off taken consistent with leave-related policies applicable to the employer's similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment. If the employer does not employ and has not recently employed more than two similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment, the employer nevertheless remains obligated to attest that the terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity are commensurate with the terms and conditions of employment for other similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment. “Similarly situated U.S. workers” includes U.S. workers performing similar duties subject to similar supervision and with similar educational backgrounds, industry expertise, employment experience, levels of responsibility, and skill sets as the student. The duties, hours, and compensation of such students are “commensurate” with those offered to U.S. workers employed by the employer in the same area of employment when the employer can show that the duties, hours, and compensation are consistent with the range of such terms and conditions the employer has offered or would offer to similarly situated U.S. employees. The student must disclose his or her compensation, including any adjustments, as agreed to with the employer, on the Form I-983 or successor form.
(9) Evaluation requirements and Training Plan modifications. (i) A student may not be authorized for employment with an employer pursuant to paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section unless the student submits a self-evaluation of the student's progress toward the training goals described in the Form I-983 or successor form. All required evaluations must be completed prior to the conclusion of a STEM practical training opportunity, and the student and an appropriate individual in the employer's organization must sign each evaluation to attest to its accuracy. All STEM practical training opportunities require an initial evaluation within 12 months of the approved starting date on the employment authorization document granted pursuant to the student's 24-month OPT extension application, and a concluding evaluation. The student is responsible for ensuring the DSO receives his or her 12-month evaluation and final evaluation no later than 10 days following the conclusion of the reporting period or conclusion of his or her practical training opportunity, respectively.
(ii) If any material change to or deviation from the training plan described in the Form I-983 or successor form occurs, the student and employer must sign a modified Form I-983 or successor form reflecting the material change(s) or deviation(s). Material changes and deviations relating to training may include, but are not limited to, any change of Employer Identification Number resulting from a corporate restructuring, any reduction in compensation from the amount previously submitted on the Form I-983 or successor form that is not tied to a reduction in hours worked, any significant decrease in hours per week that a student engages in a STEM training opportunity, and any decrease in hours worked below the minimum hours for the 24-month extension as described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(8) of this section. Material changes and deviations also include any change or deviation that renders an employer attestation inaccurate, or renders inaccurate the information in the Form I-983 or successor form on the nature, purpose, oversight, or assessment of the student's practical training opportunity. The student and employer must ensure that the modified Form I-983 or successor form is submitted to the student's DSO at the earliest available opportunity.
(iii) The educational institution whose DSO is responsible for duties associated with the student's latest OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section is responsible for ensuring the Student and Exchange Visitor Program has access to each individualized Form I-983 or successor form and associated student evaluations (electronic or hard copy), including through SEVIS if technologically available, beginning within 30 days after the document is submitted to the DSO and continuing for a period of three years following the completion of each STEM practical training opportunity.
(10) Additional STEM opportunity obligations. A student may only participate in a STEM practical training opportunity in which the employer attests, including by signing the Form I-983 or successor form, that:
(i) The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available and is prepared to provide appropriate training in connection with the specified opportunity at the location(s) specified in the Form I-983 or successor form;
(ii) The student on a STEM OPT extension will not replace a full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. worker; and
(iii) The student's opportunity assists the student in reaching his or her training goals.
(11) Site visits. DHS, at its discretion, may conduct a site visit of any employer. The purpose of the site visit is for DHS to ensure that each employer possesses and maintains the ability and resources to provide structured and guided work-based learning experiences consistent with any Form I-983 or successor form completed and signed by the employer. DHS will provide notice to the employer 48 hours in advance of any site visit, except notice may not be provided if the visit is triggered by a complaint or other evidence of noncompliance with the regulations in this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C).
(D) Duration of status while on post-completion OPT. For a student with approved post-completion OPT, the duration of status is defined as the period beginning on the date that the student's application for OPT was properly filed and pending approval, including the authorized period of post-completion OPT, and ending 60 days after the OPT employment authorization expires.
(E) Periods of unemployment during post-completion OPT. During post-completion OPT, F-1 status is dependent upon employment. Students may not accrue an aggregate of more than 90 days of unemployment during any post-completion OPT period described in 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). Students granted a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section may not accrue an aggregate of more than 150 days of unemployment during a total OPT period, including any post-completion OPT period described in 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B) and any subsequent 24-month extension period.
(11) OPT application and approval process—(i) Student responsibilities. A student must initiate the OPT application process by requesting a recommendation for OPT from his or her DSO. Upon making the recommendation, the DSO will provide the student a signed Form I-20 indicating that recommendation.
(A) Applications for employment authorization. The student must properly file an Application for Employment Authorization, Form I-765 or successor form, with USCIS, accompanied by the required fee, and the supporting documents, as described in the form's instructions.
(B) Applications and filing deadlines for pre-completion OPT and post-completion OPT—(1) Pre-completion OPT. For pre-completion OPT, the student may properly file his or her Form I-765 or successor form up to 90 days before being enrolled for one full academic year, provided that the period of employment will not start prior to the completion of the full academic year.
(2) Post-completion OPT. For post-completion OPT, not including a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section, the student may properly file his or her Form I-765 or successor form up to 90 days prior to his or her program end date and no later than 60 days after his or her program end date. The student must also file his or her Form I-765 or successor form with USCIS within 30 days of the date the DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into his or her SEVIS record.
(C) Applications and filing deadlines for 24-month OPT extension. A student meeting the eligibility requirements for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section may request an extension of employment authorization by filing Form I-765 or successor form, with the required fee and supporting documents, up to 90 days prior to the expiration date of the student's current OPT employment authorization. The student seeking such 24-month OPT extension must properly file his or her Form I-765 or successor form with USCIS within 60 days of the date the DSO enters the recommendation for the OPT extension into his or her SEVIS record. If a student timely and properly files an application for such 24-month OPT extension and timely and properly requests a DSO recommendation, including by submitting the fully executed Form I-983 or successor form to his or her DSO, but the Employment Authorization Document, Form I-766 or successor form, currently in the student's possession expires prior to the decision on the student's application for the OPT extension, the student's Form I-766 or successor form is extended automatically pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(6)(iv).
(D) Start of OPT employment. A student may not begin OPT employment prior to the approved start date on his or her Employment Authorization Document, Form I-766 or successor form, except as described in paragraph (f)(11)(i)(C) of this section. A student may not request a start date that is more than 60 days after the student's program end date. Employment authorization will begin on the date requested or the date the employment authorization is adjudicated, whichever is later.
(ii) Additional DSO responsibilities. A student must have a recommendation from his or her DSO in order to apply for OPT. When a DSO recommends a student for OPT, the school assumes the added responsibility for maintaining the SEVIS record of that student for the entire period of authorized OPT, consistent with paragraph (f)(12) of this section.
(A) Prior to making a recommendation, the DSO at the educational institution of the student's most recent enrollment must ensure that the student is eligible for the given type and period of OPT and that the student is aware of the student's responsibilities for maintaining status while on OPT. Prior to recommending a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section, the DSO at the educational institution of the student's most recent enrollment must certify that the student's degree being used to qualify that student for the 24-month OPT extension, as shown in SEVIS or official transcripts, is a bachelor's, master's, or doctorate degree with a degree code that is contained within a category on the current STEM Designated Degree Program List at the time the recommendation is made. A DSO may recommend a student for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section only if the Form I-983 or successor form described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(7) of this section has been properly completed and executed by the student and prospective employer. A DSO may not recommend a student for an OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section if the practical training would be conducted by an employer who has failed to meet the requirements under paragraphs (f)(10)(ii)(C)(5) through (9) of this section or has failed to provide the required assurances of paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(10) of this section.
(B) The DSO must update the student's SEVIS record with the DSO's recommendation for OPT before the student can apply to USCIS for employment authorization. The DSO will indicate in SEVIS whether the OPT employment is to be full-time or part-time, or for a student seeking a recommendation for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section whether the OPT employment meets the minimum hours requirements described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(8) of this section, and note in SEVIS the OPT start and end dates.
(C) The DSO must provide the student with a signed, dated Form I-20 or successor form indicating that OPT has been recommended.
(iii) Decision on application for OPT employment authorization. USCIS will adjudicate a student's Form I-765 or successor form on the basis of the DSO's recommendation and other eligibility considerations.
(A) If granted, the employment authorization period for post-completion OPT begins on the requested date of commencement or the date the Form I-765 or successor form is approved, whichever is later, and ends at the conclusion of the remaining time period of post-completion OPT eligibility. The employment authorization period for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section begins on the day after the expiration of the initial post-completion OPT employment authorization and ends 24 months thereafter, regardless of the date the actual extension is approved.
(B) USCIS will notify the applicant of the decision on the Form I-765 or successor form in writing, and, if the application is denied, of the reason or reasons for the denial.
(C) The applicant may not appeal the decision.
(12) Reporting while on optional practical training—(i) General. An F-1 student who is granted employment authorization by USCIS to engage in optional practical training is required to report any change of name or address, or interruption of such employment to the DSO for the duration of the optional practical training. A DSO who recommends a student for OPT is responsible for updating the student's record to reflect these reported changes for the duration of the time that training is authorized.
(ii) Additional reporting obligations for students with an approved 24-month OPT extension. Students with an approved 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section have additional reporting obligations. Compliance with these reporting requirements is required to maintain F-1 status. The reporting obligations are:
(A) Within 10 days of the change, the student must report to the student's DSO a change of legal name, residential or mailing address, employer name, employer address, and/or loss of employment.
(B) The student must complete a validation report, confirming that the information required by paragraph (f)(12)(ii)(A) of this section has not changed, every six months. The requirement for validation reporting starts on the date the 24-month OPT extension begins and ends when the student's F-1 status expires or the 24-month OPT extension concludes, whichever is first. The validation report is due to the student's DSO within 10 business days of each reporting date.
(13) Temporary absence from the United States of F-1 student granted employment authorization. (i) A student returning from a temporary trip abroad with an unexpired off-campus employment authorization on his or her I-20 ID may resume employment only if the student is readmitted to attend the same school which granted the employment authorization.
(ii) An F-1 student who has an unexpired EAD issued for post-completion practical training and who is otherwise admissible may return to the United States to resume employment after a period of temporary absence. The EAD must be used in combination with an I-20 ID endorsed for reentry by the DSO within the last six months.
(14) Effect of strike or other labor dispute. Any employment authorization, whether or not part of an academic program, is automatically suspended upon certification by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's designee to the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service or the Commissioner's designee, that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place of employment. As used in this paragraph, “place of employment” means the facility or facilities where a labor dispute exists. The employer is prohibited from transferring F-1 students working at other facilities to the facility where the work stoppage is occurring.
(15) Spouse and children of F-1 student. The F-2 spouse and minor children of an F-1 student shall each be issued an individual SEVIS Form I-20 in accordance with the provisions of §214.3(k).
(i) Employment. The F-2 spouse and children of an F-1 student may not accept employment.
(ii) Study—(A) F-2 post-secondary/vocational study—(1) Authorized study at SEVP-certified schools. An F-2 spouse or F-2 child may enroll in less than a full course of study, as defined in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) and (m)(9)(i) through (iv), in any course of study described in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) or (m)(9)(i) through (iv) of this section at an SEVP-certified school. Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(B) and (m)(9)(i) of this section, study at an undergraduate college or university or at a community college or junior college is not a full course of study solely because the F-2 nonimmigrant is engaging in a lesser course load to complete a course of study during the current term. An F-2 spouse or F-2 child enrolled in less than a full course of study is not eligible to engage in employment pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9) and (10) of this section or pursuant to paragraph (m)(14) of this section.
(2) Full course of study. Subject to paragraphs (f)(15)(ii)(B) and (f)(18) of this section, an F-2 spouse and child may engage in a full course of study only by applying for and obtaining a change of status to F-1, M-1 or J-1 nonimmigrant status, as appropriate, before beginning a full course of study. An F-2 spouse and child may engage in study that is avocational or recreational in nature, up to and including on a full-time basis.
(B) F-2 elementary or secondary study. An F-2 child may engage in full-time study, including any full course of study, in any elementary or secondary school (kindergarten through twelfth grade).
(C) An F-2 spouse and child violates his or her nonimmigrant status by enrolling in any study except as provided in paragraph (f)(15)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(16) Reinstatement to student status—(i) General. The district director may consider reinstating a student who makes a request for reinstatement on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, accompanied by a properly completed SEVIS Form I-20 indicating the DSO's recommendation for reinstatement (or a properly completed Form I-20A-B issued prior to January 30, 2003, from the school the student is attending or intends to attend prior to August 1, 2003). The district director may consider granting the request if the student:
(A) Has not been out of status for more than 5 months at the time of filing the request for reinstatement (or demonstrates that the failure to file within the 5 month period was the result of exceptional circumstances and that the student filed the request for reinstatement as promptly as possible under these exceptional circumstances);
(B) Does not have a record of repeated or willful violations of Service regulations;
(C) Is currently pursuing, or intending to pursue, a full course of study in the immediate future at the school which issued the Form I-20;
(D) Has not engaged in unauthorized employment;
(E) Is not deportable on any ground other than section 237(a)(1)(B) or (C)(i) of the Act; and
(F) Establishes to the satisfaction of the Service, by a detailed showing, either that:
(1) The violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond the student's control. Such circumstances might include serious injury or illness, closure of the institution, a natural disaster, or inadvertence, oversight, or neglect on the part of the DSO, but do not include instances where a pattern of repeated violations or where a willful failure on the part of the student resulted in the need for reinstatement; or
(2) The violation relates to a reduction in the student's course load that would have been within a DSO's power to authorize, and that failure to approve reinstatement would result in extreme hardship to the student.
(ii) Decision. If the Service reinstates the student, the Service shall endorse the student's copy of Form I-20 to indicate the student has been reinstated and return the form to the student. If the Form I-20 is from a non-SEVIS school, the school copy will be forwarded to the school. If the Form I-20 is from a SEVIS school, the adjudicating officer will update SEVIS to reflect the Service's decision. In either case, if the Service does not reinstate the student, the student may not appeal that decision.
(17) Current name and address. A student must inform the DSO and the Service of any legal changes to his or her name or of any change of address, within 10 days of the change, in a manner prescribed by the school. A student enrolled at a SEVIS school can satisfy the requirement in 8 CFR 265.1 of notifying the Service by providing a notice of a change of address within 10 days to the DSO, who in turn shall enter the information in SEVIS within 21 days of notification by the student. A student enrolled at a non-SEVIS school must submit a notice of change of address to the Service, as provided in 8 CFR 265.1, within 10 days of the change. Except in the case of a student who cannot receive mail where he or she resides, the address provided by the student must be the actual physical location where the student resides rather than a mailing address. In cases where a student provides a mailing address, the school must maintain a record of, and must provide upon request from the Service, the actual physical location where the student resides.
(18) Special rules for certain border commuter students—(i) Applicability. For purposes of the special rules in this paragraph (f)(18), the term “border commuter student” means a national of Canada or Mexico who is admitted to the United States as an F-1 nonimmigrant student to enroll in a full course of study, albeit on a part-time basis, in an approved school located within 75 miles of a United States land border. A border commuter student must maintain actual residence and place of abode in the student's country of nationality, and seek admission to the United States at a land border port-of-entry. These special rules do not apply to a national of Canada or Mexico who is:
(A) Residing in the United States while attending an approved school as an F-1 student, or
(B) Enrolled in a full course of study as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section.
(ii) Full course of study. The border commuter student must be enrolled in a full course of study at the school that leads to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective, albeit on a part-time basis. A designated school official at the school may authorize an eligible border commuter student to enroll in a course load below that otherwise required for a full course of study under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, provided that the reduced course load is consistent with the border commuter student's approved course of study.
(iii) Period of admission. An F-1 nonimmigrant student who is admitted as a border commuter student under this paragraph (f)(18) will be admitted until a date certain. The DSO is required to specify a completion date on the Form I-20 that reflects the actual semester or term dates for the commuter student's current term of study. A new Form I-20 will be required for each new semester or term that the border commuter student attends at the school. The provisions of paragraphs (f)(5) and (f)(7) of this section, relating to duration of status and extension of stay, are not applicable to a border commuter student.
(iv) Employment. A border commuter student may not be authorized to accept any employment in connection with his or her F-1 student status, except for curricular practical training as provided in paragraph (f)(10)(i) of this section or post-completion optional practical training as provided in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(A)(3) of this section.
(19) Remittance of the fee. An alien who applies for F-1 or F-3 nonimmigrant status in order to enroll in a program of study at a Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-approved educational institution is required to pay the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee to DHS, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.13, except as otherwise provided in that section.

Each exchange alien participating in a program of graduate medical education or training shall file Form I-644 (Supplementary Statement for Graduate Medical Trainees) annually with the Service attesting to the conditions as specified on the form. The exchange alien shall also submit Form I-644 as an attachment to a completed Form DS-2019 when applying for an extension of stay.
When the approval of an exchange visitor program is withdrawn by the Director of the United States Information Agency, the district director shall send a notice of the withdrawal to each participant in the program and a copy of each such notice shall be sent to the program sponsor. If the exchange visitor is currently engaged in activities authorized by the cancelled program, the participant is authorized to remain in the United States to engage in those activities until expiration of the period of stay previously authorized. The district director shall notify participants in cancelled programs that permission to remain in the United States as an exchange visitor, or extension of stay may be obtained if the participant is accepted in another approved program and a Form DS-2019, executed by the new program sponsor, is submitted. In this case, a release from the sponsor of the cancelled program will not be required.

(m) Students in established vocational or other recognized nonacademic institutions, other than in language training programs—(1) Admission of student—(i) Eligibility for admission. A nonimmigrant student may be admitted into the United States in nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(M) of the Act, if:
(A) The student presents a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in his or her own name by a school approved by the Service for attendance by M-1 foreign students. (In the alternative, for a student seeking admission prior to August 1, 2003, the student may present a currently-valid Form I-20M-N/I-20ID, if that form was issued by the school prior to January 30, 2003);
(B) The student has documentary evidence of financial support in the amount indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20M-N/I-20ID); and
(C) For students seeking initial admission only, the student intends to attend the school specified in the student's visa (or, where the student is exempt from the requirement for a visa, the school indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20M-N/I-20ID)).
(ii) Disposition of Form I-20M-N. When a student is admitted to the United States, the inspecting officer shall forward Form I-20M-N to the Service's processing center. The processing center shall forward Form I-20N to the school which issued the form to notify the school of the student's admission.
(iii) Use of SEVIS. On January 30, 2003, the use of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) will become mandatory for the issuance of any new Form I-20. A student or dependent who presents a non-SEVIS Form I-20 issued on or after January 30, 2003, will not be accepted for admission to the United States. Non-SEVIS Forms I-20 issued prior to January 30, 2003, will continue to be accepted for admission to the United States until August 1, 2003. However, schools must issue a SEVIS Form I-20 to any current student requiring a reportable action (e.g., extension of status, practical training, and requests for employment authorization) or a new Form I-20, or for any aliens who must obtain a new nonimmigrant student visa. As of August 1, 2003, the records of all current or continuing students must be entered in SEVIS.
(2) Form I-20 ID copy. The first time an M-1 student comes into contact with the Service for any reason, the student must present to the Service a Form I-20M-N properly and completely filled out by the student and by the designated official of the school the student is attending or intends to attend. The student will be issued a Form I-20 ID copy with his or her admission number. The student must have the Form I-20 ID copy with him or her at all times. If the student loses the Form I-20 ID copy, the student must request a new Form I-20 ID copy on Form I-102 from the Service office having jurisdiction over the school the student was last authorized to attend.
(3) Admission of the spouse and minor children of an M-1 student. The spouse and minor children accompanying an M-1 student are eligible for admission in M-2 status if the student is admitted in M-1 status. The spouse and minor children following-to-join an M-1 student are eligible for admission to the United States in M-2 status if they are able to demonstrate that the M-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study, or engaged in approved practical training following completion of studies. In either case, at the time they seek admission, the eligible spouse and minor children of an M-1 student with a SEVIS Form I-20 must individually present an original SEVIS Form I-20 issued in the name of each M-2 dependent issued by a school authorized by the Service for attendance by M-1 foreign students. Prior to August 1, 2003, if exigent circumstances are demonstrated, the Service will allow the dependent of an M-1 student in possession of a SEVIS Form I-20 to enter the United States using a copy of the M-1 student's SEVIS Form I-20. (In the alternative, for dependents seeking admission to the United States prior to August 1, 2003, a copy of the M-1 student's current Form I-20ID issued prior to January 30, 2003, with proper endorsement by the DSO will satisfy this requirement.) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or Form I-20M-N) is required for a dependent where there has been any substantive change in the M-1 student's current information.
(i) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued; or
(ii) A new Form I-20M-N if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued.
(4) Temporary absence—(i) General. An M-1 student returning to the United States from a temporary absence to attend the school which the student was previously authorized to attend must present either—
(A) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued; or
(B) A new Form I-20M-N if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued.
(ii) Student who transferred between schools. If an M-1 student has been authorized to transfer between schools and is returning to the United States from a temporary absence in order to attend the school to which transfer was authorized as indicated on the student's Form I-20 ID copy, the name of the school to which the student is destined does not need to be specified in the student's visa.
(5) Period of stay. A student in M nonimmigrant status is admitted for a fixed time period, which is the period necessary to complete the course of study indicated on the Form I-20, plus practical training following completion of the course of study, plus an additional 30 days to depart the United States, but not to exceed a total period of one year. An M-1 student may be admitted for a period up to 30 days before the report date or start date of the course of study listed on the Form I-20. An M-1 student who fails to maintain a full course of study or otherwise fails to maintain status is not eligible for the additional 30-day period of stay.
(6)-(8) [Reserved]
(9) Full course of study. Successful completion of the course of study must lead to the attainment of a specific educational or vocational objective. A “full course of study” as required by section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act means—
(i) Study at a community college or junior college, certified by a school official to consist of at least twelve semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter-hour systems, where all students enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or considered full-time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the district director) except when the student needs a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term;
(ii) Study at a postsecondary vocational or business school, other than in a language training program except as provided in §214.3(a)(2)(iv), which confers upon its graduates recognized associate or other degrees or has established that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning which are either: (1) A school (or school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof; or (2) a school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; and which has been certified by a designated school official to consist of at least twelve hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by the district director;
(iii) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic curriculum, other than in a language training program except as provided in §214.3(a)(2)(iv), certified by a designated school official to consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or at least twenty-two clock hours a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of shop or laboratory work; or
(iv) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic high school curriculum, certified by a designated school official to consist of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress towards graduation.
(v) On-line courses/distance education programs. No on-line or distance education classes may be considered to count toward an M-1 student's full course of study requirement if such classes do not require the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to completion of the class. An on-line or distance education course is a course that is offered principally through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing.
(vi) Reduced course load. The designated school official may authorize an M-1 student to engage in less than a full course of study only where the student has been compelled by illness or a medical condition that has been documented by a licensed medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or licensed clinical psychologist, to interrupt or reduce his or her course of study. A DSO may not authorize a reduced course load for more than an aggregate of 5 months per course of study. An M-1 student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to illness or medical condition for an aggregate of 5 months, may not be authorized by the DSO to reduce his or her course load on subsequent occasions during his or her particular course of study.
(A) Non-SEVIS schools. A DSO must report any student who has been authorized by the DSO to carry a reduced course load. Within 21 days of the authorization, the DSO must send a photocopy of the student's Form I-20 to the Service's data processing center indicating the date that authorization was granted. The DSO must also report to the Service's data processing center when the student has resumed a full course of study, no more than 21 days from the date the student resumed a full course of study. In this case, the DSO must submit a photocopy of the student's Form I-20 indicating the date that a full course of study was resumed, with a new program end date.
(B) SEVIS reporting. In order for a student to be authorized to drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS prior to the student reducing his or her course load. The DSO must update SEVIS with the date, reason for authorization, and the start date of the next term or session. The DSO must also notify SEVIS within 21 days of the student's commencement of a full course of study.

(10) Extension of stay—(i) Eligibility. The cumulative time of extensions that can be granted to an M-1 student is limited to a period of 3 years from the M-1 student's original start date, plus 30 days. No extension can be granted to an M-1 student if the M-1 student is unable to complete the course of study within 3 years of the original program start date. This limit includes extensions that have been granted due to a drop below full course of study, a transfer of schools, or reinstatement. An M-1 student may be granted an extension of stay if it is established that:
(A) He or she is a bona fide nonimmigrant currently maintaining student status;
(B) Compelling educational or medical reasons have resulted in a delay to his or her course of study. Delays caused by academic probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program extension; and
(C) He or she is able to, and in good faith intends to, continue to maintain that status for the period for which the extension is granted.
(ii) Application. A student must apply to the Service for an extension on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status. A student's M-2 spouse and children seeking an extension of stay must be included in the application. The student must submit the application to the service center having jurisdiction over the school the student is currently authorized to attend, at least 15 days but not more than 60 days before the program end date on the student's Form I-20. The application must also be accompanied by the student's Form I-20 and the Forms I-94 of the student's spouse and children, if applicable.
(iii) Period of stay. If an application for extension is granted, the student and the student's spouse and children, if applicable, are to be given an extension of stay for the period of time necessary to complete the course of study, plus 30 days within which to depart from the United States, or for a total period of one year, whichever is less. A student's M-2 spouse and children are not eligible for an extension unless the M-1 student is granted an extension of stay, or for a longer period than is granted to the M-1 student.
(iv) SEVIS update. A DSO must update SEVIS to recommend that a student be approved for an extension of stay. The SEVIS Form I-20 must be printed with the recommendation and new program end date for submission by mail to the service center, with Form I-539, and Forms I-94 if applicable.
(11) School transfer—(i) Eligibility. An M-1 student may not transfer to another school after six months from the date the student is first admitted as, or changes nonimmigrant classification to that of, an M-1 student unless the student is unable to remain at the school to which the student was initially admitted due to circumstances beyond the student's control. An M-1 student may be otherwise eligible to transfer to another school if the student—
(A) Is a bona fide nonimmigrant;
(B) Has been pursuing a full course of study at the school the student was last authorized to attend;
(C) Intends to pursue a full course of study at the school to which the student intends to transfer; and
(D) Is financially able to attend the school to which the student intends to transfer.
(ii) Procedure. A student must apply to the Service on Form I-539 for permission to transfer between schools. Upon application for school transfer, a student may effect the transfer subject to approval of the application. A student who transfers without complying with this requirement or whose application is denied after transfer pursuant to this regulation is considered to be out of status. If the application is approved, the approval of the transfer will be determined to be the program start date listed on the Form I-20, and the student will be granted an extension of stay for the period of time necessary to complete the new course of study plus 30 days, or for a total period of one year, whichever is less.
(A) Non-SEVIS school. The application must be accompanied by the Form I-20ID copy and the Form I-94 of the student's spouse and children, if applicable. The Form I-539 must also be accompanied by Form I-20M-N properly and completely filled out by the student and by the designated official of the school which the student wishes to attend. Upon approval, the adjudicating officer will endorse the name of the school to which the transfer is authorized on the student's Form I-20ID copy and return it to the student. The officer will also endorse Form I-20M-N to indicate that a school transfer has been authorized and forward it to the Service's processing center for updating. The processing center will forward Form I-20M-N to the school to which the transfer has been authorized to notify the school of the action taken.
(B) SEVIS school. The student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and indicate the school to which the student intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school must update SEVIS to show the student as a “transfer out” and input the “release date” for transfer. Once updated as a “transfer out” the transfer school is permitted to generate a SEVIS Form I-20 for transfer but will not gain access to the student's SEVIS record until the release date is reached. Upon receipt of the SEVIS Form I-20 from the transfer school, the student must submit Form I-539 in accordance with §214.2(m)(11). The student may enroll in the transfer school at the next available term or session and is required to notify the DSO of the transfer school immediately upon beginning attendance. The transfer school must update the student's registration record in SEVIS in accordance with §214.3(g)(3). Upon approval of the transfer application, the Service officer will endorse the name of the school to which the transfer is authorized on the student's SEVIS Form I-20 and return it to the student.
(C) Transition process. Once SEVIS is fully operational and interfaced with the service center benefit processing system, the Service officer will transmit the approval of the transfer to SEVIS and endorse the name of the school to which transfer is authorized on the student's SEVIS Form I-20 and return it to the student. As part of a transitional process until that time, the student is required to notify the DSO at the transfer school of the decision of the Service within 15 days of the receipt of the adjudication by the Service. Upon notification by the student of the approval of the Service, the DSO must immediately update SEVIS to show that approval of the transfer has been granted. The DSO must then print an updated SEVIS Form I-20 for the student indicating that the transfer has been completed. If the application for transfer is denied, the student is out of status and the DSO must terminate the student's record in SEVIS.
(iii) Student who has not been pursuing a full course of study. If an M-1 student who has not been pursuing a full course of study at the school the student was last authorized to attend desires to attend a different school, the student must apply for reinstatement to student status under paragraph (m)(16) of this section.
(12) Change in educational objective. An M-1 student may not change educational objective.
(13) Employment. Except as provided in paragraph (m)(14) of this section, a student may not accept employment.
(14) Practical training—(i) When practical training may be authorized. Temporary employment for practical training may be authorized only after completion of the student's course of study.
(A) The proposed employment is recommended for the purpose of practical training;
(B) The proposed employment is related to the student's course of study; and
(C) Upon the designated school official's information and belief, employment comparable to the proposed employment is not available to the student in the country of the student's foreign residence.
(ii) Application. A M-1 student must apply for permission to accept employment for practical training on Form I-765, with fee as contained in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), accompanied by a Form I-20 that has been endorsed for practical training by the designated school official. The application must be submitted prior to the program end date listed on the student's Form I-20 but not more than 90 days before the program end date. The designated school official must certify on Form I-538 that—
(A) The proposed employment is recommended for the purpose of practical training;
(B) The proposed employment is related to the student's course of study; and
(C) Upon the designated school official's information and belief, employment comparable to the proposed employment is not available to the student in the country of the student's foreign residence.
(iii) Duration of practical training. When the student is authorized to engage in employment for practical training, he or she will be issued an employment authorization document. The M-1 student may not begin employment until he or she has been issued an employment authorization document by the Service. One month of employment authorization will be granted for each four months of full-time study that the M-1 student has completed. However, an M-1 student may not engage in more than six months of practical training in the aggregate. The student will not be granted employment authorization if he or she cannot complete the requested practical training within six months.
(iv) Temporary absence of M-1 student granted practical training. An M-1 student who has been granted permission to accept employment for practical training and who temporarily departs from the United States, may be readmitted for the remainder of the authorized period indicated on the student's Form I-20 ID copy. The student must be returning to the United States to perform the authorized practical training. A student may not be readmitted to begin practical training which was not authorized prior to the student's departure from the United States.
(v) Effect of strike or other labor dispute. Authorization for all employment for practical training is automatically suspended upon certification by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's designee to the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization or the Commissioner's designee that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place of employment. As used in this paragraph, “place of employment” means wherever the employer or joint employer does business.
(vi) SEVIS process. The DSO must update the student's record in SEVIS to recommend that the Service approve the student for practical training, and print SEVIS Form I-20 with the recommendation, for the student to submit to the Service with Form I-765 as provided in this paragraph (m)(14).
(15) Decision on application for extension, permission to transfer to another school, or permission to accept employment for practical training. The Service shall notify the applicant of the decision and, if the application is denied, of the reason(s) for the denial. The applicant may not appeal the decision.
(16) Reinstatement to student status—(i) General. A district director may consider reinstating a student who makes a request for reinstatement on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, accompanied by a properly completed SEVIS Form I-20 indicating the DSO's recommendation for reinstatement (or a properly completed Form I-20M-N issued prior to January 30, 2003, from the school the student is attending or intends to attend prior to August 1, 2003). The district director may consider granting the request only if the student:
(A) Has not been out of status for more than 5 months at the time of filing the request for reinstatement (or demonstrates that the failure to file within the 5 month period was the result of exceptional circumstances and that the student filed the request for reinstatement as promptly as possible under these exceptional circumstances);
(B) Does not have a record of repeated or willful violations of the Service regulations;
(C) Is currently pursuing, or intends to pursue, a full course of study at the school which issued the Form I-20M-N or SEVIS Form I-20;
(D) Has not engaged in unlawful employment;
(E) Is not deportable on any ground other than section 237(a)(1)(B) or (C)(i) of the Act; and
(F) Establishes to the satisfaction of the Service, by a detailed showing, either that:
(1) The violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond the student's control. Such circumstances might include serious injury or illness, closure of the institution, a natural disaster, or inadvertence, oversight or neglect on the part of the DSO, but do not include instances where a pattern of repeated violations or where a willful failure on the part of the student resulted in the need for reinstatement; or
(2) The violation relates to a reduction in the student's course load that would have been within a DSO's power to authorize, and that failure to approve reinstatement would result in extreme hardship to the student.
(ii) Decision. If the Service reinstates the student, the Service shall endorse the student's copy of Form I-20 to indicate that the student has been reinstated and return the form to the student. If the Form I-20 is from a non-SEVIS school, the school copy will be forwarded to the school. If the Form I-20 is from a SEVIS school, the adjudicating officer will update SEVIS to reflect the Service's decision. In either case, if the Service does not reinstate the student, the student may not appeal the decision. The district director will send notification to the school of the decision.
(17) Spouse and children of M-1 student. The M-2 spouse and minor children of an M-1 student shall each be issued an individual SEVIS Form I-20 in accordance with the provisions of §214.3(k).
(i) Employment. The M-2 spouse and children may not accept employment.
(ii) Study—(A) M-2 post-secondary/vocational study—(1) Authorized study at SEVP-certified schools. An M-2 spouse or M-2 child may enroll in less than a full course of study, as defined in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) or (m)(9)(i) through (v), in any course of study described in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) or (m)(9)(i) through (v) of this section at an SEVP-certified school. Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(B) and (m)(9)(i) of this section, study at an undergraduate college or university or at a community college or junior college is not a full course of study solely because the M-2 nonimmigrant is engaging in a lesser course load to complete a course of study during the current term. An M-2 spouse or M-2 child enrolled in less than a full course of study is not eligible to engage in employment pursuant to paragraph (m)(14) of this section or pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9) through (10) of this section.
(2) Full course of study. Subject to paragraph (m)(17)(ii)(B) of this section, an M-2 spouse and child may engage in a full course of study only by applying for and obtaining a change of status to F-1, M-1, or J-1 status, as appropriate, before beginning a full course of study. An M-2 spouse and M-2 child may engage in study that is avocational or recreational in nature, up to and including on a full-time basis.
(B) M-2 elementary or secondary study. An M-2 child may engage in full-time study, including any full course of study, in any elementary or secondary school (kindergarten through twelfth grade).
(C) An M-2 spouse or child violates his or her nonimmigrant status by enrolling in any study except as provided in paragraph (m)(17)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(18) Current name and address. A student must inform the Service and the DSO of any legal changes to his or her name or of any change of address, within 10 days of the change, in a manner prescribed by the school. A student enrolled at a SEVIS school can satisfy the requirement in 8 CFR 265.1 of notifying the Service by providing a notice of a change of address within 10 days to the DSO, and the DSO in turn shall enter the information in SEVIS within 21 days of notification by the student. A nonimmigrant student enrolled at a non-SEVIS institution must submit a notice of change of address to the Service, as provided in 8 CFR 265.1, within 10 days of the change. Except in the case of a student who cannot receive mail where he or she resides, the address provided by the student must be the actual physical location where the student resides rather than a mailing address. In cases where a student provides a mailing address, the school must maintain a record of, and must provide upon request from the Service, the actual physical location where the student resides.
(19) Special rules for certain border commuter students—(i) Applicability. For purposes of the special rules in this paragraph (m)(19), the term “border commuter student” means a national of Canada or Mexico who is admitted to the United States as an M-1 student to enroll in a full course of study, albeit on a part-time basis, in an approved school located within 75 miles of a United States land border. The border commuter student must maintain actual residence and place of abode in the student's country of nationality, and seek admission to the United States at a land border port-of-entry. These special rules do not apply to a national of Canada or Mexico who is:
(A) Residing in the United States while attending an approved school as an M-1 student, or
(B) Enrolled in a full course of study as defined in paragraph (m)(9) of this section.
(ii) Full course of study. The border commuter student must be enrolled in a full course of study at the school that leads to the attainment of a specific educational or vocational objective, albeit on a part-time basis. A designated school official at the school may authorize an eligible border commuter student to enroll in a course load below that otherwise required for a full course of study under paragraph (m)(9) of this section, provided that the reduced course load is consistent with the border commuter student's approved course of study.
(iii) Period of stay. An M-1 border commuter student is not entitled to an additional 30-day period of stay otherwise available under paragraph (m)(5) of this section.
(iv) Employment. A border commuter student may not be authorized to accept any employment in connection with his or her M-1 student status, except for practical training as provided in paragraph (m)(14) of this section.
(20) Remittance of the fee. An alien who applies for M-1 or M-3 nonimmigrant status in order to enroll in a program of study at a DHS-approved vocational educational institution is required to pay the SEVIS fee to DHS, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.13, except as otherwise provided in that section.

(a) Filing petition—
(1) General. A school or school system seeking initial or continued authorization for attendance by nonimmigrant students under sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act, or both, must file a petition for certification or recertification with SEVP, using the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), in accordance with the procedures at paragraph (h) of this section. The petition must state whether the school or school system is seeking certification or recertification for attendance of nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act or both. The petition must identify by name and address each location of the school that is included in the petition for certification or recertification, specifically including any physical location in which a nonimmigrant can attend classes through the school (i.e., campus, extension campuses, satellite campuses, etc.).
(i) School systems. A school system, as used in this section, means public school (grades 9-12) or private school (grades kindergarten-12). A petition by a school system must include a list of the names and addresses of those schools included in the petition with the supporting documents.
(ii) Submission requirements. Certification and recertification petitions require that a complete Form I-17, Petition for Approval of School for Attendance by Nonimmigrant Student, including supplements A and B and bearing original signatures, be included with the school's submission of supporting documentation. In submitting the Form I-17, a school certifies that the designated school officials (DSOs) signing the form have read and understand DHS regulations relating to: Nonimmigrant students at 8 CFR 214.1, 214.2(f), and/or 214.2(m); change of nonimmigrant classification for students at 8 CFR 248; school certification and recertification under this section; withdrawal of school certification under this section and 8 CFR 214.4; that both the school and its DSOs intend to comply with these regulations at all times; and that, to the best of its knowledge, the school is eligible for SEVP certification. Willful misstatements may constitute perjury (18 U.S.C. 1621).
(2) Approval for F-1 or M-1 classification, or both—(i) F-1 classification. The following schools may be approved for attendance by nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act:
(A) A college or university, i.e., an institution of higher learning which awards recognized bachelor's, master's doctor's or professional degrees.
(B) A community college or junior college which provides instruction in the liberal arts or in the professions and which awards recognized associate degrees.
(C) A seminary.
(D) A conservatory.
(E) An academic high school.
(F) A private elementary school.
(G) An institution which provides language training, instruction in the liberal arts or fine arts, instruction in the professions, or instruction or training in more than one of these disciplines.
(ii) M-1 classification. The following schools are considered to be vocational or nonacademic institutions and may be approved for attendance by nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act:
(A) A community college or junior college which provides vocational or technical training and which awards recognized associate degrees.
(B) A vocational high school.
(C) A school which provides vocational or nonacademic training other than language training.
(iii) Both F-1 and M-1 classification. A school may be approved for attendance by nonimmigrant students under both sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) and 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act if it has both instruction in the liberal arts, fine arts, language, religion, or the professions and vocational or technical training. In that case, a student whose primary intent is to pursue studies in liberal arts, fine arts, language, religion, or the professions at the school is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act. A student whose primary intent is to pursue vocational or technical training at the school is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act.
(iv) English language training for a vocational student. A student whose primary intent is to pursue vocational or technical training who takes English language training at the same school solely for the purpose of being able to understand the vocational or technical course of study is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act.
(v) The following may not be approved for attendance by foreign students:
(A) A home school,
(B) A public elementary school, or
(C) An adult education program, as defined by section 203(l) of the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, Public Law 105-220, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 9202(l), if the adult education program is funded in whole or in part by a grant under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, or by any other Federal, State, county or municipal funding.

(A) Remains eligible for certification in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section;
(B) Has complied during its previous period of certification or recertification with recordkeeping, retention, and reporting requirements and all other requirements of paragraphs (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section.
(b) Supporting documents. Institutions petitioning for certification or recertification must submit certain supporting documents as follows, pursuant to sections 101(a)(15)(F) and (M) of the Act. A petitioning school or school system owned and operated as a public educational institution or system by the United States or a State or a political subdivision thereof shall submit a certification to that effect signed by the appropriate public official who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so. A petitioning private or parochial elementary or secondary school system shall submit a certification signed by the appropriate public official who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so to the effect that it meets the requirements of the State or local public educational system. Any other petitioning school shall submit a certification by the appropriate licensing, approving, or accrediting official who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so to the effect that it is licensed, approved, or accredited. In lieu of such certification a school which offers courses recognized by a State-approving agency as appropriate for study for veterans under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3675 and 3676 may submit a statement of recognition signed by the appropriate official of the State approving agency who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so. A charter shall not be considered a license, approval, or accreditation. A school catalogue, if one is issued, shall also be submitted with each petition. If not included in the catalogue, or if a catalogue is not issued, the school shall furnish a written statement containing information concerning the size of its physical plant, nature of its facilities for study and training, educational, vocational or professional qualifications of the teaching staff, salaries of the teachers, attendance and scholastic grading policy, amount and character of supervisory and consultative services available to students and trainees, and finances (including a certified copy of the accountant's last statement of school's net worth, income, and expenses). Neither a catalogue nor such a written statement need be included with a petition submitted by:
(1) A school or school system owned and operated as a public educational institution or system by the United States or a State or a political subdivision thereof;
(2) A school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; or
(3) A secondary school operated by or as part of a school so accredited.
(c) Other evidence. If the petitioner is a vocational, business, or language school, or American institution of research recognized as such by the Secretary of Homeland Security, it must submit evidence that its courses of study are accepted as fulfilling the requirements for the attainment of an educational, professional, or vocational objective, and are not avocational or recreational in character. If the petitioner is a vocational, business, or language school, or American institution of research recognized as such by the Attorney General, it must submit evidence that its courses of study are accepted as fulfilling the requirements for the attainment of an educational, professional, or vocational objective, and are not avocational or recreational in character. If the petitioner is an institution of higher education and is not within the category described in paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section, it must submit evidence that it confers upon its graduates recognized bachelor, master, doctor, professional, or divinity degrees, or if it does not confer such degrees that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three such institutions of higher learning. If the petitioner is an elementary or secondary school and is not within the category described in paragraph (b) (1) or (3) of this section, it must submit evidence that attendance at the petitioning institution satisfies the compulsory attendance requirements of the State in which it is located and that the petitioning school qualifies graduates for acceptance by schools of a higher educational level within the category described in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section.
(d) Interview of petitioner. The petitioner or an authorized representative of the petitioner may be required to appear in person before or be interviewed by telephone by a DHS representative prior to the adjudication of a petition for certification or recertification. The interview will be conducted under oath.
(e) Notices to schools related to certification or recertification petitions or to out-of-cycle review—(1) General. All notices from SEVP to schools or school systems related to school certification, recertification, or out-of-cycle review (including, but not limited to, notices related to the collection of evidence, testimony, and appearance pertaining to petitions for recertification encompassing compliance with the recordkeeping, retention and reporting, and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section, as well as to eligibility) will be served in accordance with the procedures at 8 CFR 103.2(b)(1), (4)-(16), (18) and (19), with the exception that all procedures will be conducted by SEVP, the SEVP Director, and the Assistant Secretary, ICE, as appropriate, and except as provided in this section. All such notices will be served (i.e., generated and transmitted) through SEVIS and/or by e-mail. The date of service is the date of transmission of the e-mail notice. DSOs must maintain current contact information, including current e-mail addresses, at all times. Failure of a school to receive SEVP notices due to inaccurate DSO e-mail addresses in SEVIS or blockages of the school's e-mail system caused by spam filters is not grounds for appeal of a denial or withdrawal. The term “in writing” means either a paper copy bearing original signatures or an electronic copy bearing electronic signatures.
(2) SEVP approval notification and SEVIS updating by certified schools. SEVP will notify the petitioner by updating SEVIS to reflect approval of the petition and by e-mail upon approval of a certification or recertification petition. The certification or recertification is valid only for the type of program and nonimmigrant classification specified in the certification or recertification approval notice. The certification must be recertified every two years and may be subject to out-of-cycle review at any time. Approval may be withdrawn in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4.
(3) Modifications to Form I-17 while a school is SEVP-certified. Any modification made by an SEVP-certified school on the Form I-17 at any time after certification and for the duration of a school's authorization to enroll F and/or M students must be reported to SEVP and will be processed by SEVP in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (f)(1), (g)(2) and (h)(3)(i) of this section.
(4) Notice of Intent to Withdraw (NOIW) SEVP certification—(i) Automatic withdrawal. SEVP will serve the school with an NOIW 30 days prior to a school's SEVP certification expiration date if the school has not submitted to SEVP a completed recertification petition, in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The school will be automatically withdrawn immediately, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(a)(3), if it has not submitted a completed recertification petition by the school's certification expiration date.
(ii) Withdrawal on notice. SEVP will serve a Withdrawal on Notice, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(b), if SEVP determines that a school reviewed out-of-cycle has failed to sustain eligibility or has failed to comply with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section. When a school fails to file an answer to an NOIW within the 30-day period, SEVP will withdraw the school's certification and notify the DSOs of the decision, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(d). Such withdrawal of certification may not be appealed.
(5) Notice of Denial. A Notice of Denial will be served to a school when SEVP denies a petition for initial certification or recertification. The notice will address appeals options. Schools denied recertification must comply with 8 CFR 214.4(i).
(6) Notice of Automatic Withdrawal. Schools that relinquish SEVP certification for any of the reasons cited in 8 CFR 214.4(a)(3) will be served a Notice of Automatic Withdrawal.
(7) Notice of Withdrawal. A school found to be ineligible for continued SEVP certification as a result of an out-of-cycle review will receive a Notice of Withdrawal. Schools withdrawn must comply with 8 CFR 214.4(i).
(8) Notice of SEVIS Access Termination Date. The Notice of SEVIS Access Termination Date gives the official date for the school's denial or withdrawal to be final and SEVIS access to be terminated. In most situations, SEVP will not determine a SEVIS access termination date for that school until the appeals process has concluded and the initial denial or withdrawal has been upheld, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(i)(3). The school will no longer be able to access SEVIS and SEVP will automatically terminate any remaining Active SEVIS records for that school on that date.
(f) Adjudication of a petition for SEVP certification or recertification — (1) Approval. The school is required to immediately report through SEVIS any change to its school information upon approval of a petition for SEVP certification or recertification. Modification to school information listed in paragraph (h)(3) of this section will require a determination of continued eligibility for certification. The certification or recertification is valid only for the type of program and student specified in the approval notice. The certification may be withdrawn in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.4, is subject to review at any time, and will be reviewed every two years.
(2) Denial. The petitioner will be notified of the reasons for the denial and appeal rights, in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR part 103 and 8 CFR 214.4, if SEVP denies a petition for certification or recertification.

(g) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements — (1) Student records. An SEVP-certified school must keep records containing certain specific information and documents relating to each F-1 or M-1 student to whom it has issued a Form I-20, while the student is attending the school and until the school notifies SEVP, in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, that the student is not pursuing a full course of study. Student information not required for entry in SEVIS may be kept in the school's student system of records, but must be accessible to DSOs. The school must keep a record of having complied with the reporting requirements for at least three years after the student is no longer pursuing a full course of study. The school must maintain records on the student in accordance with paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section if a school recommends reinstatement for a student who is out of status. The school must maintain records on the student for three years from the date of the denial if the reinstatement is denied. The DSO must make the information and documents required by this paragraph available, including academic transcripts, and must furnish them to DHS representatives upon request. Schools must maintain and be able to provide an academic transcript or other routinely maintained student records that reflect the total, unabridged academic history of the student at the institution, in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section. All courses must be recorded in the academic period in which the course was taken and graded. The information and documents that the school must keep on each student are as follows:

(ii) Identification of the student, to include name while in attendance (record any legal name change), date and place of birth, country of citizenship, and school's student identification number.
(iii) Current address where the student and his or her dependents physically reside. In the event the student or his or her dependents cannot receive mail at such physical residence, the school must provide a mailing address in SEVIS. If the mailing address and the physical address are not the same, the school must maintain a record of both mailing and physical addresses and provide the physical location of residence of the student and his or her dependents to DHS upon request.
(iv) Record of coursework. Identify the student's degree program and field of study. For each course, give the periods of enrollment, course identification code and course title; the number of credits or contact hours, and the grade; the number of credits or clock hours, and for credit hour courses the credit unit; the term unit (semester hour, quarter hour, etc.). Include the date of withdrawal if the student withdrew from a course. Show the grade point average for each session or term. Show the cumulative credits or clock hours and cumulative grade point average. Narrative evaluation will be accepted in lieu of grades when the school uses no other type of grading.
(v) Record of transfer credit or clock hours accepted. Type of hours, course identification, grades.
(vi) Academic status. Include the effective date or period if suspended, dismissed, placed on probation, or withdrawn.
(vii) Whether the student has been certified for practical training, and the beginning and end dates of certification.
(viii) Statement of graduation (if applicable). Title of degree or credential received, date conferred, program of study or major.
(ix) Termination date and reason.
(x) The documents referred to in paragraph (k) of this section.
Note to paragraph (g)(1): A DHS officer may request any or all of the data in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (x) of this section on any individual student or class of students upon notice. This notice will be in writing if requested by the school. The school will have three work days to respond to any request for information concerning an individual student, and ten work days to respond to any request for information concerning a class of students. The school will respond orally on the same day the request for information is made if DHS requests information on a student who is being held in custody, and DHS will provide a written notification that the request was made after the fact, if the school so desires. DHS will first attempt to gain information concerning a class of students from DHS record systems.
(2) Reporting changes in student and school information. (i) Schools must update SEVIS with the current information within 21 days of a change in any of the information contained in paragraphs (f)(1) and (h)(3) of this section.
(ii) Schools are also required to report within 21 days any change of the information contained in paragraph (g)(1) or the occurrence of the following events:
(A) Any student who has failed to maintain status or complete his or her program;
(B) A change of the student's or dependent's legal name or U.S. address;
(C) Any student who has graduated early or prior to the program end date listed on SEVIS Form I-20;
(D) Any disciplinary action taken by the school against the student as a result of the student being convicted of a crime; and
(E) Any other notification request not covered by paragraph (g)(1) of this section made by DHS with respect to the current status of the student.
(F) For F-1 students authorized by USCIS to engage in a 17-month extension of OPT,
(1) Any change that the student reports to the school concerning legal name, residential or mailing address, employer name, or employer address; and
(2) The end date of the student's employment reported by a former employer in accordance with §214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(4).
(iii) Each term or session and no later than 30 days after the deadline for registering for classes, schools are required to report the following registration information:
(A) Whether the student has enrolled at the school, dropped below a full course of study without prior authorization by the DSO, or failed to enroll;
(B) The current address of each enrolled student; and
(C) The start date of the student's next session, term, semester, trimester, or quarter. For initial students, the start date is the “program start date” or “report date.” (These terms are used interchangeably.) The DSO may choose a reasonable date to accommodate a student's need to be in attendance for required activities at the school prior to the actual start of classes when determining the report date on the Form I-20. Such required activities may include, but are not limited to, research projects and orientation sessions. The DSO may not, however, indicate a report date more than 30 days prior to the start of classes. The next session start date is the start of classes for continuing students.
(D) Adjustment to the program completion date. Any factors that influence the student's progress toward program completion (e.g., deferred attendance, authorized drop below, program extension) must be reflected by making an adjustment updating the program completion date.
(3) Administrative correction of a student's record. In instances where technological or computer problems on the part of SEVIS cause an error in the student's record, the DSO may request the SEVIS system administrator, without fee, to administratively correct the student's record.
(h) SEVP certification, recertification, out-of-cycle review, and oversight of schools—(1) Certification. A school seeking SEVP certification for attendance by nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(m)(i) of the Act must use SEVIS to file an electronic petition (which compiles the data for the Form I-17) and must submit the nonrefundable certification petition fee on-line.
(i) Filing a petition. The school must access the SEVP Web site at http://www.ice.gov/sevis to file a certification petition in SEVIS. The school will be issued a temporary ID and password in order to access SEVIS to complete and submit an electronic Form I-17. The school must submit the proper nonrefundable certification petition fee as provided in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1).
(ii) Site visit, petition adjudication and school notification. SEVP will conduct a site visit for each petitioning school and its additional schools or campuses. SEVP will contact the school to arrange the site visit. The school must comply with and complete the visit within 30 days after the date SEVP contacts the school to arrange the visit, or the petition for certification will be denied as abandoned. DSOs and school officials that have signed the school's Form I-17 petition must be able to demonstrate to DHS representatives how they obtain access to the regulations cited in the certification as part of the site visit. Paper or electronic access is acceptable. DSOs must be able to extract pertinent citations within the regulations related to their requirements and responsibilities. SEVP will serve a notice of approval and SEVIS will be updated to reflect the school's certification if SEVP approves the school's certification petition.
(iii) Certification denial. SEVP will serve a notice of denial in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section if a school's petition for certification is denied.
(2) Recertification. Schools are required to file a completed petition for SEVP recertification before the school's certification expiration date, which is two years from the date of their previous SEVP certification or recertification expiration date, except for the first recertification cycle after publication of the recertification rule. There is no recertification petition fee. SEVP will review a petitioning school's compliance with the recordkeeping, retention and reporting, and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section, as well as continued eligibility for certification, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(i) Filing of petition for recertification. Schools must submit a completed Form I-17 (including supplements A and B) using SEVIS, and submit a paper copy of the Form I-17 bearing original signatures of all officials. SEVP will notify all DSOs of a previously certified school 180 days prior to the school's certification expiration date that the school may submit a petition for recertification. A school may file its recertification petition at any time after receipt of this notification. A school must submit a complete recertification petition package, as outlined in the submission guidelines, by its certification expiration date. SEVP will send a notice of confirmation of complete filing or rejection to the school upon receipt of any filing of a petition for recertification.
(A) Notice of confirmation assures a school of uninterrupted access to SEVIS while SEVP adjudicates the school's petition for recertification. A school that has complied with the petition submission requirements will continue to have SEVIS access after its certification expiration date while the adjudication for recertification is pending. The school is required to comply with all regulatory recordkeeping, retention and reporting, and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section during the period the petition is pending.
(B) Notice of rejection informs a school that it must take prompt corrective action in regard to its recertification petition prior to its certification expiration date to ensure that its SEVIS access will not be terminated and its petition for recertification will be accepted for adjudication.
(ii) Consequence of failure to petition. SEVP will serve an NOIW to the school 30 days prior to a school's certification expiration date. SEVP will no longer accept a petition for recertification from the school and will immediately withdraw the school's certification if the school does not petition for recertification, abandons its petition, or does not submit a complete recertification petition package by the certification expiration date, in accordance with the automatic withdrawal criteria in 8 CFR 214.4(a)(3). The school must comply with 8 CFR 214.4(i) upon withdrawal.
(iii) School recertification process—(A) General. School recertification reaffirms the petitioning school's eligibility for SEVP certification and the school's compliance with recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section since its previous certification.
(B) Compliance. Assessment by SEVP of a school petitioning for recertification will focus primarily on overall school compliance, but may also include examination of individual DSO compliance as data and circumstances warrant. Past performance of these individuals, whether or not they continue to serve as principal designated school officials (PDSOs) or DSOs, will be considered in any petition for recertification of the school.
(C) On-site review for recertification. All schools are subject to on-site review, at the discretion of SEVP, in conjunction with recertification. The school must comply with and complete an on-site review within 30 days of the notification by a DHS representative of a school that it has been selected for an on-site review for recertification, or the petition for recertification will be denied as abandoned, resulting in the school's withdrawal from SEVIS.
(iv) Recertification approval. SEVP will serve a notice of approval if a school's petition for recertification is approved. The date of the subsequent recertification review will be two years after the school's certification expiration date from this petition cycle.
(v) Recertification denial. SEVP will serve a notice of denial if a school's petition for recertification is denied, in accordance with 8 CFR 103.3(a)(1)(i).
(vi) Adjustment of certification expiration date. Schools eligible for recertification before March 25, 2009 will, at a minimum, have their certification expiration date extended to March 25, 2009. SEVP may extend the certification expiration date beyond this date during the first cycle of recertification.
(3) Out-of-cycle review and oversight of SEVP-certified schools. (i) SEVP will determine if out-of-cycle review is required upon receipt in SEVIS of any changes from an SEVP-certified school to its Form I-17 information. The Form I-17 information that requires out-of-cycle review when changed includes:
(A) Approval for attendance of students (F/M/both);
(B) Name of school system; name of main campus;
(C) Mailing address of the school;
(D) Location of the school;
(E) School type;
(F) Public/private school indicator;
(G) Private school owner name;
(H) The school is engaged in;
(I) The school operates under the following Federal, State, Local or other authorization;
(J) The school has been approved by the following national, regional, or state accrediting association or agency;
(K) Areas of study;
(L) Degrees available from the school;
(M) If the school is engaged in elementary or secondary education;
(N) If the school is engaged in higher education;
(O) If the school is engaged in vocational or technical education;
(P) If the school is engaged in English language training;
(Q) Adding or deleting campuses;
(R) Campus name;
(S) Campus mailing address; and
(T) Campus location address.
(ii) SEVP may request a school to electronically update all Form I-17 fields in SEVIS and provide SEVP with documentation supporting the update. The school must complete such updates in SEVIS and submit the supporting documentation to SEVP within 10 business days of the request from SEVP.
(iii) SEVP may review a school's certification at any time to verify the school's compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section to verify the school's continued eligibility for SEVP certification pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section. SEVP may initiate remedial action with the school, as appropriate, and may initiate withdrawal proceedings against the school pursuant to 8 CFR 214.4(b) if noncompliance or ineligibility of a school is identified.
(iv) On-site review. SEVP-certified schools are subject to on-site review at any time. SEVP will initiate withdrawal proceedings against a certified school, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.4(b), if the certified school selected for on-site review prior to its certification expiration date fails to comply with and complete the review within 30 days of the date SEVP contacted the school to arrange the review.
(v) Notice of Continued Eligibility. SEVP will serve the school a notice of continued eligibility if, upon completion of an out-of-cycle review, SEVP determines that the school remains eligible for certification. Such notice will not change the school's previously-determined certification expiration date unless specifically notified by SEVP.
(vi) Withdrawal of certification. SEVP will institute withdrawal proceedings in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(b) if, upon completion of an out-of-cycle review, SEVP determines that a school or its programs are no longer eligible for certification.
(vii) Voluntary withdrawal. A school can voluntarily withdraw from SEVP certification at any time or in lieu of complying with an out-of-cycle review or request. Failure of a school to comply with an out-of-cycle review or request by SEVP will be treated as a voluntary withdrawal. A school must initiate voluntary withdrawal by sending a request for withdrawal on official school letterhead to SEVP.
(i) Administration of student regulations. DHS officials may conduct out-of-cycle, on-site reviews on the campuses of SEVP-certified schools to determine whether nonimmigrant students on those campuses are complying with DHS regulations pertaining to them, including the requirement that each maintains a valid passport. DHS officers will take appropriate action regarding violations of the regulations by nonimmigrant students.

(j) Advertising. In any advertisement, catalogue, brochure, pamphlet, literature, or other material hereafter printed or reprinted by or for an approved school, any statement which may appear in such material concerning approval for attendance by nonimmigrant students shall be limited solely to the following: This school is authorized under Federal law to enroll nonimmigrant alien students.
(k) Issuance of Certificate of Eligibility. A DSO of an SEVP-certified school must sign any completed Form I-20 issued for either a prospective or continuing student or a dependent. A Form I-20 issued by a certified school system must state which school within the system the student will attend. Only a DSO of an SEVP-certified school may issue a Form I-20 to a prospective student and his or her dependents, and only after the following conditions are met:
(1) The prospective student has made a written application to the school.
(2) The written application, the student's transcripts or other records of courses taken, proof of financial responsibility for the student, and other supporting documents have been received, reviewed, and evaluated at the school's location in the United States.
(3) The appropriate school authority has determined that the prospective student's qualifications meet all standards for admission.
(4) The official responsible for admission at the school has accepted the prospective student for enrollment in a full course of study.
(l) Designated Official. (1) Meaning of term Designated Official. As used in §§214.1(b), 214.2(b), 214.2(f), 214.2(m), and 214.4, a Designated Official, Designated School Official (DSO), or Principal Designated School Official (PDSO), means a regularly employed member of the school administration whose office is located at the school and whose compensation does not come from commissions for recruitment of foreign students. An individual whose principal obligation to the school is to recruit foreign students for compensation does not qualify as a designated official. The PDSO and any other DSO must be named by the president, owner, or head of a school or school system. The PDSO and DSO may not delegate this designation to any other person.
(i) A PDSO and DSO must be either a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States.
(ii) Each campus must have one PDSO. The PDSO is responsible for updating SEVIS to reflect the addition or deletion of any DSO on his or her associated campus. SEVP will use the PDSO as the point of contact on any issues that relate to the school's compliance with the regulations, as well as any system alerts generated by SEVIS. SEVP may also designate certain functions in SEVIS for use by the PDSO only. The PDSO of the main campus is the only DSO authorized to submit a Form I-17 for recertification. The PDSO and DSO will share the same responsibilities in all other respects.
(iii) School officials may nominate as many DSOs in addition to PDSOs as they determine necessary to adequately provide recommendations to F and/or M students enrolled at the school regarding maintenance of nonimmigrant status and to support timely and complete recordkeeping and reporting to DHS, as required by this section. School officials must not permit a DSO or PDSO nominee access to SEVIS until DHS approves the nomination.
(2) Name, title, and sample signature. Petitions for SEVP certification, review and recertification must include the names, titles, and sample signatures of designated officials. An SEVP-certified school must update SEVIS upon any changes to the persons who are principal or designated officials, and furnish the name, title and e-mail address of any new official within 21 days of the change. Any changes to the PDSO or DSO must be made by the PDSO within 21 days of the change. DHS may, at its discretion, reject the submission of any individual as a DSO or withdraw a previous submission by a school of an individual.
(3) Statement of designated officials. A petition for school approval must include a statement by each designated official certifying that the official is familiar with the Service regulations relating to the requirements for admission and maintenance of status of nonimmigrant students, change of nonimmigrant status under part 248 of this chapter, and school approval under §§214.3 and 214.4, and affirming the official's intent to comply with these regulations. At the time a new designated official is added, the designated official must make the same certification.

(a) General—(1) Denial of certification. The petitioning school will be notified of the reasons and appeal rights if a petition for certification is denied, in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 103.3(a)(1)(iii). A petitioning school denied certification may file a new petition for certification at any time.
(2) Denial of recertification or withdrawal on notice. The school must wait at least one calendar year from the date of denial of recertification or withdrawal on notice before being eligible to petition again for SEVP certification if a school's petition for recertification is denied by SEVP pursuant to 8 CFR 214.3(h)(3)(v), or its certification is withdrawn on notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. Eligibility to re-petition will be at the discretion of the Director of SEVP. SEVP certification of a school or school system for the attendance of nonimmigrant students, pursuant to sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) and/or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, will be withdrawn on notice subsequent to out-of-cycle review, or recertification denied, if the school or school system is determined to no longer be entitled to certification for any valid and substantive reason including, but not limited to, the following:
(i) Failure to comply with 8 CFR 214.3(g)(1) without a subpoena.
(ii) Failure to comply with 8 CFR 214.3(g)(2).
(iii) Failure of a DSO to notify SEVP of the attendance of an F-1 transfer student as required by 8 CFR 214.2(f)(8)(ii).
(iv) Failure of a DSO to identify on the Form I-20 which school within the system the student must attend, in compliance with 8 CFR 214.3(k).
(v) Willful issuance by a DSO of a false statement, including wrongful certification of a statement by signature, in connection with a student's school transfer or application for employment or practical training.
(vi) Conduct on the part of a DSO that does not comply with the regulations.
(vii) The designation as a DSO of an individual who does not meet the requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(l)(1).
(viii) Failure to provide SEVP paper copies of the school's Form I-17 bearing the names, titles, and signatures of DSOs as required by 8 CFR 214.3(l)(2).
(ix) Failure to submit statements of DSOs as required by 8 CFR 214.3(l)(3).
(x) Issuance of Forms I-20 to students without receipt of proof that the students have met scholastic, language, or financial requirements as required by 8 CFR 214.3(k)(2).
(xi) Issuance of Forms I-20 to aliens who will not be enrolled in or carry full courses of study, as defined in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6) or 214.2(m)(9).
(xii) Failure to operate as a bona fide institution of learning.
(xiii) Failure to employ adequate qualified professional personnel.
(xiv) Failure to limit advertising in the manner prescribed in 8 CFR 214.3(j).
(xv) Failure to maintain proper facilities for instruction.
(xvi) Failure to maintain accreditation or licensing necessary to qualify graduates as represented in the school's Form I-17.
(xvii) Failure to maintain the physical plant, curriculum, and teaching staff in the manner represented in the Form I-17.
(xviii) Failure to comply with the procedures for issuance of Forms I-20 as set forth in 8 CFR 214.3(k).
(xix) Failure of a DSO to notify SEVP of material changes, such as changes to the school's name, address, or curricular changes that represent material change to the scope of institution offerings (e.g., addition of a program, class or course for which the school is issuing Forms I-20, but which does not have Form I-17 approval), as required by 8 CFR 214.3(f)(1).
(3) Automatic withdrawal. A school that is automatically withdrawn and subsequently wishes to enroll nonimmigrant students in the future may file a new petition for SEVP certification at any time. The school must use the certification petition procedures described in 8 CFR 214.3(h)(1) to gain access to SEVIS for submitting its petition. Past compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l), and with the requirements for transition of students under paragraph (i) of this section will be considered in the evaluation of a school's subsequent petition for certification. SEVP certification will be automatically withdrawn:
(i) As of the date of termination of operations, if an SEVP-certified school terminates its operations.
(ii) As of a school's certification expiration date, if an SEVP-certified school does not submit a completed recertification petition in the manner required by 8 CFR 214.3(h)(2).
(iii) Sixty days after the change of ownership if an SEVP-certified school changes ownership, unless the school files a new petition for SEVP certification, in accordance with the procedures at 8 CFR 214.3(h)(1), within 60 days of the change of ownership. SEVP will review the petition if the school properly files such petition to determine whether the school still meets the eligibility requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(a)(3) and is still in compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l). SEVP will institute withdrawal proceedings in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section if, upon completion of the review, SEVP finds that the school is no longer eligible for certification, or is not in compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l).
(iv) If an SEVP-certified school voluntarily withdraws from its certification.
(4) Automatic withdrawal as of SEVIS mandatory compliance date. The present approval of any school that has not filed for enrollment in SEVIS by the mandatory compliance date for attendance of nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act is automatically withdrawn as of the day following the mandatory compliance date for SEVIS. Given the time necessary to conduct a review of each school, the Service will review and adjudicate Form I-17 petitions for approval in SEVIS prior to the SEVIS mandatory compliance date only for Form I-17 petitions filed at least 75 days prior to this mandatory date. If a Form I-17 petition is filed less than 75 days prior to the mandatory compliance date and is not adjudicated prior to the mandatory compliance date, the school will not be authorized to access SEVIS and will be unable to issue any SEVIS Forms I-20 until the adjudication is complete.
(b) Withdrawal on notice. SEVP will initiate an out-of-cycle review and serve the school with an NOIW if SEVP has information that a school or school system may no longer be entitled to SEVP certification prior to the school being due for its two-year recertification. The NOIW will inform the school of:
(1) The grounds for withdrawing SEVP certification.
(2) The 30-day deadline from the date of the service of the NOIW for the school to submit sworn statements, and documentary or other evidence, to rebut the grounds for withdrawal of certification in the NOIW. An NOIW is not a means for the school to submit evidence that it should have previously submitted as a part of its established reporting requirements.
(3) The school's right to submit a written request (including e-mail) within 30 days of the date of service of the NOIW for a telephonic interview in support of its response to the NOIW.
(c) Assistance of counsel. The school or school system shall also be informed in the notice of intent to withdraw approval that it may be assisted or represented by counsel of its choice qualified under part 292 of this chapter, at no expense to the Government, in preparation of its answer or in connection with the interview.
(d) Allegations admitted or no answer filed. If the school or school system admits all of the allegations in the notice of intent to withdraw approval, or if the school or school system fails to file an answer within the 30-day period, the district director shall withdraw the approval previously granted and he/she shall notify the designated school official of the decision. No appeal shall lie from the district director's decision if all allegations are admitted or no answer is filed within the 30-day period.
(e) Allegations denied. If the school or school system denies the allegations in the notice of intent to withdraw approval, then the school or school system shall, in its answer, provide all information or evidence on which the answer is based.
(f) Interview requested. (1) If in its answer to the notice of intent to withdraw approval the school or school system requests an interview, the school or school system shall be given notice of the date set for the interview.
(2) A summary of the information provided by the school or school system at the interview shall be prepared and included in the record. In the discretion of the district director, the interview may be recorded.
(g) Decision. The decision of SEVP will be in accordance with 8 CFR 103.3(a)(1).
(h) Appeals. Notices of denial or withdrawal of SEVP certification will include appeal alternatives and filing instructions. Any appeal must be taken within 15 days after the service of the decision by stating the reasons for the appeal in the notice of appeal provided with the instructions, and supported by a statement or brief specifically setting forth the grounds for contesting the withdrawal of the approval. No fee is required with appeals related to denial of SEVP recertification or withdrawal of SEVP certification.
(i) Operations at a school when SEVP certification is relinquished or withdrawn, or whose recertification is denied and on the SEVIS access termination date—(1) General. A school whose certification is relinquished or withdrawn, or whose recertification is denied may, at SEVP discretion, no longer be able to create Initial student records or issue new Forms I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student, for initial attendance. Schools must comply with the instructions given in the notice of withdrawal or denial with regard to management of status for their Initial and continuing F and/or M students. All other SEVIS functionality, including event reporting for students, will remain unchanged until the school's SEVIS access termination date. The school must continue to comply with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) until its SEVIS access termination date.
(2) SEVIS access termination. In determining the SEVIS access termination date, SEVP will consider the impact that such date will have upon SEVP, the school, and the school's nonimmigrant students in determining the SEVIS access termination date. In most situations, SEVP will not determine a SEVIS access termination date for that school until the appeals process has concluded and the initial denial or withdrawal has been upheld unless a school whose certification is withdrawn or whose recertification is denied is suspected of criminal activity or poses a potential national security threat. The school will no longer be able to access SEVIS, and SEVP will automatically terminate any remaining Active SEVIS records for that school on the SEVIS access termination date.
(3) Legal obligations and ramifications for a school and its DSOs when a school is having SEVP certification denied or withdrawn. Schools are obligated to their students to provide the programs of study to which they have committed themselves in the students' application for enrollment and acceptance process. Schools are obligated to the U.S. government to comply with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements contained in 8 CFR 214.3. With any new petition for SEVP certification, SEVP will consider the extent to which a school has fulfilled these obligations to students and the U.S. government during any previous period of SEVP certification.

(2) Dependents of F, M, or J nonimmigrants. The principal alien must pay the fee, when required under this section, in order for his/her qualifying dependents to obtain F-2, J-2, or M-2 status. However, an F-2, J-2, or M-2 dependent is not required to pay a separate fee under this section in order to obtain that status or during the time he/she remains in that status.
(3) A nonimmigrant described in paragraph (a) of this section whose Form I-20 or Form DS-2019 for initial attendance was issued on or before August 31, 2004.

(d) Time for payment of SEVIS fee. An alien who is subject to payment of the SEVIS fee must remit the fee directly to DHS as follows:
(1) An alien seeking an F-1, F-3, J-1, M-1, or M-3 visa from a consular officer abroad for initial attendance at a DHS-approved school or to commence participation in a Department of State-designated exchange visitor program, must pay the fee to DHS before issuance of the visa.
(2) An alien who is exempt from the visa requirement described in section 212(d)(4) of the Act must pay the fee to DHS before the alien applies for admission at a U.S. port-of-entry to begin initial attendance at a DHS-approved school or initial participation in a Department of State-designated exchange visitor program.
(3) A nonimmigrant alien in the United States seeking a change of status to F-1, F-3, J-1, M-1, or M-3 must pay the fee to DHS before the alien is granted the change of nonimmigrant status, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.

(6) A J-1 nonimmigrant who is applying for reinstatement after a substantive violation of status, or who has been out of program status for longer than 120 days but less than 270 days during the course of his/her program must pay a new fee to DHS, if applicable, prior to being granted a reinstatement to valid J-1 status.
(7) An F or M student who is applying for reinstatement of student status because of a violation of status, and who has been out of status for a period of time that exceeds the presumptive ineligibility deadline set forth in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(16)(i)(A) or (m)(16)(i)(A), must pay a new fee to DHS prior to being granted a return to valid status.
(8) An F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 nonimmigrant who has been absent from the United States for a period that exceeds 5 months in duration, and wishes to reenter the United States to engage in further study in the same course of study, with the exception of students who have been working toward completion of a U.S. course of study in authorized overseas study, must pay a new fee to DHS prior to being granted student status.
(e) Circumstances where no new fee is required.
(1) Extension of stay, transfer, or optional practical training for students. An F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 nonimmigrant is not required to pay a new fee in connection with:
(i) An application for an extension of stay, as provided in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(7) or (m)(10);
(ii) An application for transfer, as provided in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(8) or (m)(11);
(iii) A change in educational level, as provided in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(ii); or
(iv) An application for post-completion practical training, as provided in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii) or (m)(14).
(2) Extension of program or transfer for exchange visitors. A J-1 nonimmigrant is not required to pay a new fee in connection with:
(i) An application for an extension of program, as provided in 22 CFR 62.43; or
(ii) An application for transfer of program, as provided in 22 CFR 62.42.
(3) Visa issuance for a continuation of study. An F-1, F-3, J-1, M-1, or M-3 nonimmigrant who has previously paid the fee is not required to pay a new fee in order to be granted a visa to return to the United States as a continuing student or exchange visitor in a single course of study, so long as the nonimmigrant is not otherwise required to pay a new fee in accordance with the other provisions in this section.
(4) Certain changes in student classification.
(i) No fee is required for changes between the F-1 and F-3 classifications, and no fee is required for changes between the M-1 and M-3 classifications.
(ii) Institutional reclassification. DHS retains the discretionary authority to waive the additional fee requirement when a nonimmigrant changes classification between F and M, if the change of status is due solely to institutional reclassification by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program during that nonimmigrant's course of study.
(5) Re-application following denial of application by consular officer. An alien who fully paid a SEVIS fee in connection with an initial application for an F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 visa, or a J-1 visa in a particular program category, whose initial application was denied, and who is reapplying for the same status, or the same J-1 exchange visitor category, within 12 months following the initial notice of denial is not required to repay the SEVIS fee.
(6) Re-application following denial of an application for a change of status. A nonimmigrant who fully paid a SEVIS fee in connection with an initial application for a change of status within in the United States to F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 classification, or for a change of status to a particular J-1 exchange visitor category, whose initial application was denied, and who is granted a motion to reopen the denied case is not required to repay the SEVIS fee if the motion to reopen is granted within 12 months of receipt of initial notice of denial.
(f) [Reserved]
(g) Procedures for payment of the SEVIS fee. (1) Options for payment. An alien subject to payment of a fee under this section may pay the fee by any procedure approved by DHS, including:
(2) Receipts. DHS will provide a receipt for each fee payment under paragraph (g)(1) of this section until such time as DHS issues a notice in the Federal Register that paper receipts will no longer be necessary. Further receipt provisions include:
(3) Electronic record of fee payment. DHS will maintain an electronic record of payment for the alien as verification of receipt of the required fee under this section. If DHS records indicate that the fee has been paid, an alien who has lost or did not receive a receipt for a fee payment under this section will not be denied an immigration benefit, including visa issuance or admission to the United States, solely because of a failure to present a paper receipt of fee payment.
(4) Third-party payments. DHS will accept payment of the required fee for an alien from an approved school or a designated exchange visitor program sponsor, or from another source, in accordance with procedures approved by DHS.
(h) Failure to pay the fee. The failure to pay the required fee is grounds for denial of F, M, or J nonimmigrant status or status-related benefits. Payment of the fee does not preserve the lawful status of any F, J, or M nonimmigrant that has violated his or her status in some other manner.

New USCIS Policies for International Students & Companies,"Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has updated its policy guidance for F and M student visas, consolidating various rules into one clear document to reduce confusion and increase transparency for students and businesses. This includes clarifications on maintaining foreign residence while pursuing permanent residency, and new options for F-1 STEM students to work with startups during their Optional Practical Training (OPT) extensions.
The guidance addresses key areas such as employment authorization, change of status, extension of stay, and reinstatement of status for F and M students and their dependents in the United States.
The updated guidance emphasizes that F and M students must maintain a foreign residence and not intend to permanently abandon their home country.
Despite this, the policy now allows students to apply for permanent residency through green cards in the U.S. It’s crucial for students to demonstrate their intention to return to their home country after their temporary stay in the U.S., even as they explore long-term options.
For F-1 students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, the policy update is particularly noteworthy. It offers an extension of Optional Practical Training (OPT) for those seeking employment opportunities with startup companies.
The startups must comply with specific requirements: they need to adhere to the outlined training plans, be in good standing with E-Verify, and provide compensation that is on par with similarly situated U.S. workers. This creates new employment opportunities but also requires students and their employers to be vigilant about meeting these conditions.
USCIS has provided detailed explanations regarding the maintenance of student status. This includes comprehensive guidance on transferring schools, exploring different employment options while on a student visa, and the procedures for applying for various benefits.
The clearer guidelines help students understand their responsibilities and rights under their visa status. However, it also means that students need to be more proactive in ensuring their activities and employment align with these updated rules to maintain their legal status in the U.S.
While the policy update offers greater flexibility and opens up new avenues, it’s essential for students to plan their future in the U.S. with these regulations in mind.
Whether it’s considering long-term residency or seeking employment post-graduation, students should factor in these updated guidelines in their decision-making process.
IMPORTANT: With these changes, the onus is on the students to stay informed and compliant with the updated policies. This involves regularly checking for any new updates or changes in immigration policies that might affect their status.

“Understanding and adapting to the USCIS’s new policy guidance is crucial for employers seeking to tap into the rich pool of international talent. This guidance not only opens up new avenues for hiring bright minds, especially in the STEM fields, but also brings a responsibility to ensure compliance with the nuanced requirements,” said Hendrik Pretorius, Immigration Attorney and Director of Account Management at Boundless. “As companies navigate these changes, it’s important to strike a balance between leveraging global talent and adhering to the intricate landscape of immigration policies. Proactive engagement and informed strategies will be key to harnessing the potential of international students in a way that benefits both the students and the growth of our companies.”
USCIS’s revised policy guidance is a pivotal development for both F and M international students and U.S. employers. It aims to simplify and clarify the complexities of student visa categories, providing a clearer path for students pursuing education and career opportunities in the United States. For students, it opens doors to new opportunities, particularly in STEM fields, and delineates the conditions under which they can pursue permanent residency while on a student visa. Employers stand to benefit from a broader pool of international talent, especially in specialized STEM areas, with the added responsibility of ensuring compliance with the specific requirements of the OPT program. This guidance symbolizes a stride towards a more integrated and supportive framework for international students and the companies that seek to employ them, fostering an environment of growth, innovation, and mutual benefit. As we navigate these changes, the importance of staying informed, adhering to legal requirements, and seeking expert advice cannot be overstated, ensuring that the potential of these policies is fully realized for the enrichment of both international students and the American workforce.

Maintaining Status - Study in the States - Homeland Security,"Official website of the Department of Homeland Security
On April 2, 2024, the U.S.
Read More >

On April 2, 2024, the U.S.
While studying in the United States, it is important to maintain your F or M student status. Your status relates to the purpose, or reason for why you want to come to the United States. The U.S. Department of State issues you your visa based on your intended purpose. 
If the Department of State issues you an F or M student visa, this means that you are coming to the United States to study. You should not take any action that detracts from that purpose. Maintaining your status means:
Fulfilling the purpose for why the Department of State issued you your visa.
Following the regulations associated with that purpose.
F-1 and M-1 students share the same primary purpose for coming to the United States however, F-1 students enroll in more traditional academic programs, while M-1 students enroll in vocational programs. Because these two types of programs are different in nature, the types of benefits an international student may be eligible for and how long they may remain in the country depend on whether they are an F-1 or M-1 student.  Learn more about these specific differences by reviewing the F&M Student Status: Know the Difference infographic.
Below are actions to take in order to properly maintain your status.
When arriving to the United States, both F and M students must:
Enter the United States no more than 30 days before your program of study begins.
Immediately contact your designated school official (DSO) when you enter the United States.
When you arrive at school, you need to contact your DSO again, no later than the program start date listed on your Form I-20, ""Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.""
While studying in the United States, both F and M students must:
F-1 students must complete at least one full academic year at an SEVP-certified school to be eligible for annual vacation. Additionally, students must intend to register for classes in the academic term following their annual vacation.
SEVP-certified schools should have clear and consistent policies regarding annual vacation and comply with the requirements laid out in SEVP Policy Guidance for Adjudicators 1408-01: Academic Year.
Please note that during an annual vacation, students can take as many, as few or no courses as they want. SEVP considers all study during an annual vacation incident to status.
An F student may only work when authorized by a DSO in some cases, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in others. If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately, and you may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date. 
F students are also eligible for optional practical training during or following the program of study. OPT is a form of temporary employment that directly relates to your program of study. 
For more information about employment and training options available for F-students, visit the Working in the United States page and talk with your DSO.
M-1 students are not eligible for employment during their program of study, but may obtain authorization for practical training employment. You may participate in practical training employment after the completion of your vocational program. 
If you want to participate in practical training employment in the United States, talk with your DSO about your options. Practical training employment requires your DSO’s recommendation and authorization from USCIS. 
If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately. You may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date.
F and M students must take action to maintain legal status or depart the United States after completing your program of study.
Once you complete your program of study and any authorized period of practical training, F students have 60 days after completion of your program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. If you wish to extend your stay in the United States, talk with your DSO to learn more about doing one of the following:
Transfer to another school.
Change your education level (e.g. bachelor’s to master’s).
Apply to change status  to another visa status (e.g. H-1B-temporary worker; O-extraordinary ability in science, art or business; P-athlete).
M students have 30 days after completion of their program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. The latest date you may remain in the United States is the “admit until” date on your Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record,” unless you filed for an extension with USCIS.
If you are an F or M student studying in the United States, your DSO should be the first person you talk with if you have any questions regarding the legal requirements of your stay in the United States. Your DSO can assist in answering your questions or help you find someone who can help.
M-1 students should speak with their DSO if they are planning to do any of the following:
Take a break from school.
Travel outside the United States.
Move to a new address.
Request a program extension.
Both F and M students may contact SEVP by email at sevp@ice.dhs.gov if your DSO is unable to assist you or if you would prefer to ask someone else.
In your email, please describe your situation and include any questions you have. SEVP provides responses on a first-come, first-served basis. Answer times may vary depending on the current number of inquiries.

U.S. Laws | Office of International Students & Scholars,"While you're at Yale you are expected to follow laws and policies that govern a variety of daily life and academic activities. In the U.S. there are different levels of laws, including federal, state, and local community laws which might differ depending on the jurisdiction. Violating a U.S. law can have different consequences for an international student or scholar than for Americans, and can negatively impact your U.S. immigration status.
While it is unlikely that you will encounter any legal difficulties, there are times in life when the unexpected happens. Knowing the law can make all the difference, so it is important to be aware of the policies and laws that you are subject to. OISS advisers can provide legal referrals, and are available to listen confidentially, provide guidance and discuss any concerns you may have.
Sexual misconduct incorporates a range of behaviors including sexual assault, harassment, intimate partner violence, stalking, voyeurism, and any other conduct of a sexual nature that is nonconsensual, or has the purpose or effect of threatening, intimidating, or coercing a person. For more details, including definitions, university policies and resources, please visit this page. Yale strives to be a community free of sexual misconduct, by promoting the essential values of respect and responsibility, providing education, and working with students, faculty, and staff to create a community that is safe and supportive for all. Yale takes all complaints and accusations of sexual misconduct seriously. More information on sexual misconduct resources.
Consent can only be accurately gauged through direct communication about the decision to engage in sexual activity. Presumptions based upon contextual factors (such as clothing, alcohol consumption, or dancing) are unwarranted, and should not be considered as evidence for consent. Although consent does not need to be verbal, verbal communication is the most reliable form of asking for and gauging consent. Talking with sexual partners about desires and limits may seem awkward, but serves as the basis for positive sexual experiences shaped by mutual willingness and respect. (Excerpted from Guidance Regarding Sexual Consent.)
SHARE is available to members of the Yale community who are dealing with sexual misconduct of any kind. SHARE responders are Yale University mental health professionals. All calls to SHARE are confidential, and can be anonymous if you wish. SHARE will offer information and support, and sometimes recommendations, but won't tell you what to do — their goal is to help you make your own informed, empowered decisions. You can call SHARE at any time of night or day, any day of the year: (203) 432-2000.

Visa Regulations Int Students | Global Programs and ...,"To enter and remain in the United States as a student on a non-immigrant visa, you
                     must comply with a variety of laws and regulations mandated by the U.S. government.
                     A major responsibility of the Office of Global Education is to advise you on these
                     regulations and assist students in maintaining their legal status in the United States.  The following information summarizes some of the basic points relating to immigration
                     requirements for international students, but should not be relied upon as legal advice.
                     Immigration laws undergo almost constant revision and interpretation, and each case
                     presents unique circumstances. If you have any questions about your immigration status,
                     please come to the Office of Global Education for the latest information.
Passport - This document is issued by the government of your country and is required to depart
                     and re-enter your country as well as the United States. Your passport must be valid
                     at all times during your stay in the United States.  U.S. Visa - Stamped in your passport by the U.S. Consulate. It enables you to enter the U.S.
                     for the time of its validity.  Normally, students in the U.S. have either an F-1 or
                     J-1 visa.  Immigration Status - This refers to your visa category, such as F-1, F-2, J-1, J-2, B-2, etc.  I-20 Form - When you are admitted to the University, you are sent an I-20 form. You must present
                     this form to the U.S. Consulate to receive an F-1 visa. The SEVIS Form I-20 consists of three pages (page 3 contains instructions and page 2 is for signatures). The program end date under Program of Study on the I-20 is the expected date of
                     completion for your academic program. Each F-1 student must retain his/her Form I-20 to establish legal status in the U.S.  DS-2019 Form - If you are accepted as an exchange student or come as an exchange scholar, the
                     Office of Global Education will send you this form. You must present this form to
                     the U.S. Consulate to receive a J-1 visa. The DS-2019 form shows the authorized program participation dates and a description of the exchange
                     program.
I-94 -The I-94 is the Arrival/Departure Record issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) when you enter the United States. Your I-94 record confirms that you have been legally
                     admitted to the United States in a specific visa status, and for what duration of
                     time. For F and J visa holders, the amount of time is indicated by the notation “D/S” which means you can be in the United States for the Duration of Status of your student
                     or scholar program.    CBP creates electronic I-94 records at all airports and seaports. You must access
                     your I-94 record after entering the United States from the I-94 Website. Review all information and ensure that it is correct. Print out your I-94 record
                     and keep it with your other immigration documents. The electronic I-94 record will
                     continue to be available to you while you remain in the United States. Once you depart
                     the United States, your electronic I-94 record will no longer be available for you
                     to view. Each time you re-enter the Unites States, a new electronic I-94 will be created.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding your I-94, please make an appointment
                     to meet with an international student advisor.
 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) - The U.S. government agency which enforces U.S. immigration laws at ports of entry (formerly the INS).
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) - The U.S. government agency that provides support services to visa students and
                        other noncitizens in the U.S. (formerly the INS).
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) - The U.S. government agency that maintains and monitors the SEVIS system and enforces
                     immigration regulations.  Employment Authorization Document (EAD) - Small plastic card issued by the Department of Homeland Security to show authorization
                     for employment. The EAD is also called Form I-688B.  Passport Verification - The University is required by law to maintain records for each non-immigrant student
                     at CSU San Marcos. All international students must participate in passport verification
                     prior to their initial enrollment (this is typically done during International Student
                     Orientation).
Change of Status (COS) - Under certain circumstances, persons who enter the U.S. in one visa status are
                     permitted to petition for a change of status when conditions change. 
The immigration officer at the port of entry (CBP) grants duration of status to F-1 students by entering the notation ""D/S"" on both
                     the I-20 Form and I-94.  Full Course of Study CSU San Marcos defines a full course of study as a minimum of 12 credit units for
                     undergraduate students, and 9 credit units for graduate students. 
The law does not require a student to take all credit units each semester at CSU San
                     Marcos. However, campus policy requires undergraduate international students to enroll
                     for a minimum of 12 credit units at CSU San Marcos each semester, allowing concurrent
                     enrollment at another institution for additional credits. Under special circumstances,
                     and only for academic reasons, continuing undergraduate students may petition to take
                     a minimum of 9 credit units at CSU San Marcos and additional units at another institution.
                     An exception to this minimum credit requirement may also be made for new students
                     who arrive too late to enroll in required courses and must take these courses at another
                     institution to satisfy the full-time requirement.
All requests to take fewer than the minimum number of credit units must be submitted
                     to the International Student Advisor on a form provided for that purpose.  The form
                     can be obtained from the Office of Global Education.
A student may not drop below a full course of study during a semester without prior
                        approval from the International Student Advisor. Failure to obtain approval to drop
                        below a full course of study will put a student out of status and will require formal
                        reinstatement.
Limitations on Duration of Status The Program End Date under ""Program of Study"" on the most recent I-20 Form that was
                     issued is the date by which USCIS expects you to complete requirements for the current program. If you are unable to
                     complete the program of study by that date, you should come to the Office of Global
                     Education at least 30 days before reaching the I-20 completion date. If you are eligible
                     for an extension of time, the Office of Global Education will advise you on how to
                     receive an extension and comply with its requirements.  ""Out of Status""/""Reinstatement""   If the date for completion of studies on the I-20 has expired and you have not applied
                     for an extension of stay, or if you have not maintained a full course of study,or
                     you have done something else to violate your F-1 status, you may be ""out of status.""
                     You should contact the Office of Global Education immediately to find out about the
                     possibility of reinstating your status with USCIS.
Travel Abroad and Re-entry Before you make a trip outside the U.S., you must have page 2 of the SEVIS Form I-20 form endorsed (signed) by a DSO (Designated School Officer). The DSO's signature
                     verifies that you are maintaining a full course of study and are eligible to continue
                     as a student at CSU San Marcos when you return to the U.S. This signature is required
                     for all trips outside the U.S., including day trips to Tijuana, Mexico. Please allow
                     time for the DSO to process the I-20 before the expected date of departure.  
You should also check to be sure that the F-1 visa stamped in your passport has not
                     expired.  It is legal to remain in the U.S. with an expired F-1 visa as long as you

Overview
The J-1 Exchange Visitor Program is sponsored by the United States State Department. The
                     purpose of the program is to give students and scholars the opportunity to study or
                     work in the United States, thereby experiencing American culture first-hand. Generally
                     speaking, the program is not intended for self-supporting students who wish to come
                     to the United States to earn a degree, nor for scholars interested in permanent academic
                     positions. 
CSU San Marcos is a designated sponsor of the Exchange Visitor Program. This means
                     that students and scholars wishing to come to CSU San Marcos for the purposes designated
                     by the program can receive a DS-2019 from the Office of Global Education, which will enable them to apply for a J-1 visa
                     at a U.S. Consulate.
There are a number of restrictions that apply to the J-1 visa that you should be aware
                     of before applying. These include:
CSU San Marcos offers a policy that complies with all U.S. government requirements.
                     Information regarding the health insurance policy can be found in the Office of Global
                     Education.   J-1 Students
Duration of Status/Extension of Stay J-1 students are granted a Duration of Status (D/S) which allows them to stay in
                     the U.S. until the date shown in item #3 of the DS-2019 Form. If an extension of stay is required, the student must contact the J-1 Responsible
                     Officer at least two months before the expiration.  Short Trips Out of the United States To enter the U.S. in J-1 status, an exchange visitor is required to have the DS-2019 endorsed by the J-1 ""Responsible Officer"" (Danielle McMartin) or the ""Alternate Responsible
                     Officer"" (Ryan Bobst) confirming either enrollment or affiliation with CSU San Marcos
                     and the continuing availability of financial support. In addition, J-1 holders need
                     a valid visa stamp to reenter the U.S. If the visa stamp has expired, you will be
                     required to apply for a new visa at a U.S. Consulate abroad.  Employment  As a J-1 Exchange Visitor, the student may be eligible for a variety of work opportunities
                     in the United States, but employment without proper authorization is a serious violation
                     of the immigration status.  Employment is defined as any type of work performed or
                     services provided in exchange for money, tuition, fees, books, supplies, room, or
                     for any other benefit. The J-1 student must obtain approval in writing before commencing
                     any type of employment in the U.S. Before approval, the Responsible Officer is obligated
                     to evaluate the proposed employment in the context of the program and the student's
                     personal circumstances, and then decide whether it would be appropriate or not to
                     recommend employment.  J-1 ""Student Employment"" is limited to 20 hours per week except during holidays and
                     annual vacation. The J-1 Responsible Officer can approve Student Employment for up
                     to one year at a time. Examples of this type of employment include on-campus assistantships,
                     other on-campus jobs, and off-campus jobs which are necessary because of serious,
                     urgent and unforeseen economic circumstances.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.

Federal Policies on Immigrant Students,"The United States establishes policies at the federal level that impact higher education access, degree completion, and post-graduate career prospects for DACA and undocumented, international, and other immigrant students. This page summarizes and tracks key federal policies, proposed legislation, and administrative actions impacting these communities. 
Visit our states page to learn more about state-level policies.
There are currently more than 408,000 undocumented students enrolled in postsecondary education, representing about 1.9 percent of all postsecondary students.
While most undocumented students pursuing postsecondary education do not have DACA, the vast majority, accounting for three out of four undocumented students, came to the U.S. at a young age. Without U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, these students face significant barriers to higher education.
Currently, children who arrive with a parent who has an H-1B high skill visa or certain other nonimmigrant visas are able to maintain their legal status as the visa holder’s dependent until the age of 21. However, if parents do not secure a green card before the dependent reaches 21, these children “age out” of their dependent status and must leave the United States, even if their parent has a DHS-approved green card petition. Young people in this situation have referred to themselves as “Documented Dreamers.”
Documented Dreamers and undocumented students with and without DACA are unable to access federal financial aid. In addition, many states do not allow undocumented students to pay more affordable in-state tuition rates and preclude them from accessing in-state financial aid. These barriers can significantly impact students’ ability to pursue higher education, as well as their post-graduate employment opportunities. 
The sections below highlight current policies that impact higher education access, degree completion, and post-graduate career prospects for undocumented students, including DACA recipients.
DACA is a deferred action policy implemented by the Obama administration in June 2012. DACA protects certain undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, providing two-year work permits and protection from deportation. DACA is temporary and can be revoked by the federal government. It does not provide a path to citizenship.
Less than half of the 408,000 undocumented students currently enrolled in higher education are eligible for or currently benefit from DACA. Projections for undocumented students graduating from high school are even smaller: while nearly 100,000 undocumented students are graduating high school annually, only a quarter of them are estimated to be eligible for DACA. Many of these students arrived in the United States as children and meet the same criteria as current DACA recipients. 
January 20, 2021. The Biden administration issues Preserving and Fortifying Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a new memorandum that directed the DHS Secretary to “fortify and protect” DACA. The issuance of this memorandum signals the start of official rollbacks of the Trump administration’s efforts to end DACA. 
September 28, 2021. The Biden administration issues a new regulation to formally meet the goals of the memorandum. The administration begins the notice and comment process to address criticisms that the first memo did not comply with the Administrative Procedures Act, the formal process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations. 
August 30, 2022. DHS issues the final regulation.
October 31, 2022. The rule becomes effective. 
February 14, 2023.  USCIS issues new guidance requiring adjudicators to make it possible for individuals to maintain their dependent status for longer periods of time. Under the provisions of this guidance, individuals who previously aged out are potentially able to reopen past denials by filing a Notice of Appeal or Motion.
Litigation against DACA began in 2018 and is currently ongoing. The timeline below outlines key moments over the last several years impacting the program’s future. 
May 1, 2018. Seven states file a lawsuit against the program, arguing that the Department of Homeland Security does not have the authority to grant the protections provided in the program. 
July 16, 2021. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas agrees and vacates the original memo that created the program.
September 10, 2021. The Biden administration appeals the decision to the Fifth Circuit of the Court of Appeals. New DACA regulation is released several weeks later.
October 5, 2022. The Fifth Circuit rules that DACA’s creation violated the Administrative Procedures Act and remands the case to the U.S. District Court for review. Although the court preserved the deportation protections and employment authorizations for current DACA recipients and permitted DHS to process renewals, it prohibited the agency from receiving new applications. 
October 14, 2022. The court maintains the same conditions for the program and asks the administration to provide additional information in order to make a final ruling. 
February 1, 2023. The same group of states escalates its efforts to end the program by filing a motion pressing the U.S. District Court overseeing the litigation to determine whether the 2022 DACA rule is also unlawful and to block the government from approving renewal applications two years after a decision is made.
September 13, 2023. Judge Hanen of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas finds the 2022 DACA regulation unlawful, writing that it was not materially different from the 2012 DACA memorandum he and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals previously found to be unlawful on both procedural and substantive grounds. Judge Hanen stays the order terminating DACA as to existing recipients, allowing DHS to continue to process renewals. 
November 9, 2023. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) files a notice of appeal, arguing that the states failed to prove injury from DACA’s implementation and that the rule is a lawful exercise of presidential discretion and requesting that the Fifth Circuit review Hanen’s ruling.  
What’s next? The case now goes back to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The briefing stage will take place in early 2024, followed by oral arguments. The decision by the Fifth Circuit could be issued in the summer or fall of 2024. It is widely expected that the Fifth Circuit will uphold Judge Hanen’s ruling that the DACA program is unlawful and that the case will then be appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 bars the provision of “state and local public benefits,” including “postsecondary benefits,” for “non-qualified aliens” unless the state passes an affirmative law making them explicitly eligible. Some courts view financial aid, in-state tuition, and even admission as public benefits. Approximately 23 states and D.C. offer in-state tuition to undocumented students. 
In light of this restriction, states – through legislation, regulations, or education board policies – must affirmatively expand access to postsecondary benefits for most immigrant students. Before 1996, all immigrants were generally eligible for postsecondary benefits. However, since 1996, only states that have enacted affirmative policies on postsecondary benefits offer these benefits to immigrant students.

Higher Ed Components of Key Immigration Legislation Impacting Undocumented Students (Presidents’ Alliance, 2021).
PRWORA also bars the provision of “state and local public benefits,” including “professional, commercial, and business licenses” (also known as “occupational licenses”) for “non-qualified aliens” unless the state passes an affirmative law making them explicitly eligible.
Over 1,100 different occupations require a license and approximately 25 percent of all workers nationwide are required to obtain a license to work in their occupations. Licensure is essential for many graduates from higher education to utilize their degree. Without access to licensure, individuals may not be able to fully leverage their education, which can significantly impact their economic stability in the United States.

The Skills and Economic Outcomes of Immigrant and U.S.-Born College Graduates (Migration Policy Institute (MPI), 2022).
Section 505 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRAIRA) bars states from providing “postsecondary education benefits” to those who are “not lawfully present” based on in-state residency unless all citizens of the U.S. are eligible for those benefits regardless of state residency.
Approximately 23 states and D.C. offer in-state tuition on a variety of non-residency grounds (e.g., high school graduation in the state or similar), thereby overcoming the section 505 prohibition. Legal challenges to such programs, including an existing legal challenge in Texas, still often cite section 505. The threat that courts will interpret section 505 in more restrictive ways remains in the coming years, potentially putting these in-state tuition laws at risk.

The REAL ID Act imposes standards on identification documents that the federal government will accept for purposes of identification, most notably boarding commercial aircraft.
The deadline for REAL ID enforcement has been extended to May 7, 2025, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
These standards may interfere with immigrant and international students’ ability to enroll and/or participate in their education, particularly in terms of being able to travel to the location of their higher education. While 18 states and D.C. provide undocumented individuals with access to driver licenses, these licenses are usually not REAL ID-compliant.
In February 2023, Senators Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) and Lindsay Graham (R-South Carolina) introduced the Dream Act of 2023 (S. 365). Under the bill, an immigrant can obtain permanent relief if they:
Under the Dream Act of 2021, the prior iteration of this bill, upwards of 1.7 million DACA recipients and other Dreamers would have been eligible for lawful permanent resident (LPR) status. Under the Dream Act of 2023, close to three million undocumented youth and young adults would be potential beneficiaries. Nearly one million people could become eligible if they enroll in school. The bill would also repeal barriers for states seeking to offer in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants.
H.R.6 – The American Dream and Promise Act, was introduced by Representative Sylvia Garcia (D-TX) in June 2023. 
Through this bill, undocumented youth who came to the U.S. as minors would become eligible for conditional permanent resident status for ten years if they:
To qualify, applicants must demonstrate continuous presence in the United States since January 1, 2021, pass a background check, and enroll in or complete an educational program. 
This bill would also restrict states from providing higher education benefits to undocumented students unless those benefits are also made available to all U.S. nationals without regard to residency in the state.
H.R.3194 – the U.S. Citizenship Act was introduced in the House in May 2023 by Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-CA).  This bill seeks to establish a new “lawful prospective immigrant” status for noncitizens who have been in the United States since January 1, 2021 and pass a background check.
Under this bill certain non-citizens would be eligible for permanent resident status if they:
Eligible Dreamers, TPS recipients, and agricultural workers would be immediately eligible for green cards, as would their spouses and children. Individuals who qualify for lawful prospective immigrant status under this bill may be able to apply for permanent resident status after five years.  
This bill also seeks to address the root causes of migration, create safe and legal channels for migration, modernize the border, and protect border communities. Key provisions include: 
H.R. 3599 – the Dignity for Immigrants while Guarding our Nation to Ignite and Deliver the American Dream Act of 2023 (the DIGNIDAD (Dignity) Act), presents opportunities for removal deferral for eligible noncitizens and increases funding for activities related to border security.
Dignity status would grant undocumented people who meet eligibility criteria permanently renewable legal status, along with work and travel authority. 
To participate in the program, Dignity beneficiaries must: 
The Dignity Act addresses a variety of other topics, including: 
among others. 
The SUCCEED Act (S.1852) authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to cancel the removal of undocumented migrants who entered the United States as children and grant them conditional permanent resident status if they:
To qualify, applicants cannot have a criminal history and must demonstrate good moral character, educational attainment and/or military service, and compliance with tax responsibilities. The bill would allow undocumented individuals to apply for naturalization five years after adjustment to lawful permanent resident status and to apply for lawful permanent residence after 10 years of conditional status. 
In order to provide relief for “Documented Dreamers,” a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced the America’s Cultivation of Hope and Inclusion for Long-term Dependents Raised and Educated Natively Act of 2021 (H.R. 4331, or the America’s CHILDREN Act. This act allows the children of temporary work visa holders who graduated from U.S. institutions of higher education and meet other requirements the ability to directly apply for a green card. Although Congress did not pass this bill, there were discussions to add similar language in the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act as an amendment for the bill.
The sections below highlight current policies that shape international students’ prospects for staying and working in the United States. 
The U.S. does not currently have a national strategy to attract, welcome, and retain international students, although the Biden-Harris administration did release a Joint Statement of Principles to guide agencies in their work related to international education. As other countries are proactively implementing politics to attract and retain the best and brightest from around the world, the White House should develop and implement a coordinated U.S. International Education strategy, and each agency should set clear goals and strategies for how to attract, support and retain a greater diversity of international students pursuing their degrees and work opportunities in the United States.
Under current federal policies, international students enrolling at colleges and universities usually enter the U.S. on F-1 visas, which are, single-intent “non-immigrant” visas. Universities and colleges have been working hard to stem the decline in international student enrollments, but without a national recruitment and retention strategy, which would enable international students to more easily stay and work in the U.S. after they graduate, the U.S. is at a disadvantage with other competitor countries. 
International (or foreign) students applying for F-1 visas to study at U.S. colleges and universities arrive in the country as “nonimmigrants,” which means that international students must show that they intend to enter the U.S. “temporarily and solely for the purpose of pursuing such a course of study.” By assuming all F-1 students will be “non-immigrants,” current law does not permit individuals who are being screened for a student visa or when entering the U.S. to communicate an interest in transferring to another legal status or staying in the U.S. to build their career after the completion of their degree. 
In contrast, dual intent is an immigration law concept that allows a person to enter the United States with “nonimmigrant intent” (“I intend to leave the United States when my visa term is up”) while also maintaining the possibility of staying (“While in the United States, I also want to try to qualify for a more permanent status”). Dual intent is currently available in other nonimmigrant categories such as specialty workers (H-1B) and intracompany transferees (L-1).
From a higher education perspective, expanding dual intent for full time international students pursuing a U.S. degree would increase the attractiveness of the U.S. as a destination for talented international students in the competitive global marketplace, better match the expectations of many prospective and current international students, and align with the country’s economic and national interests. In contrast to countries such as Canada, the U.S. also does not have a proper entrepreneur visa that would allow foreign students to start their own firms, a pathway that largely does not exist for H-1B holders since they must work for a sponsoring employer at a designated worksite.
Next steps: Although the Biden Administration has made progress in clarifying how consular officers should interpret non-immigrant intent for students, Congressional legislation is needed that would 1) update INA language to remove the requirement to maintain a foreign residence abroad for F visa applicants, and 2) expand the list of visas eligible for dual intent to include F-1s.
Optional Practical Training (OPT) is an experiential learning opportunity and work program available to international students. International students may participate in “pre-completion” OPT while enrolled or “post-completion” OPT, upon the completion of their studies. OPT offers temporary employment authorization to international students in the United States, allowing eligible students and recent graduates to gain valuable work experience within their field of study. Standard OPT is for 12 months. STEM OPT offers eligible students with STEM degrees to apply for a 24-month extension.
OPT/STEM OPT are key channels through which international students contribute to American higher education, innovation, scientific discovery, and economic growth. See Presidents’ Alliance post on OPT.

The H-1B visa program allows employers to contract non-citizens for high-skilled positions for a three-year term with the potential to renew this status for another three-year period. The program maintains 65,000 new visas each fiscal year, with an additional 20,000 visas available for non-citizens with a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. institution of higher education. The program also exempts institutions of higher education and affiliated nonprofit organizations from the H-1B cap. For those employers subject to the H-1B cap, the program distributes visas every year through a lottery that randomly selects employers that sponsored non-citizens for a H-1B visa or requested an extension of H-1B status for existing beneficiaries.
The H-1B program serves as one of the primary pathways for international alumni and professionals to stay and work in the U.S., and contribute to innovation, research, and the economy .
DHS has the authority to designate countries experiencing severe economic hardship due to humanitarian concerns for Special Student Relief (SSR), which suspends certain regulatory requirements for F-1 students from these countries. SSR can suspend restrictions related to on- and off-campus employment and alter the full course of study requirements for eligible F-1 students by permitting a reduced course load.
The Biden administration has issued an increased number of SSR designations in recent years for countries facing significant conflicts or humanitarian disasters. A chart with current SSR designations can be found below.
Special Student Relief Designations and Decision Dates (Chart Regularly Updated) (TPS-DED AAC, 2022).
The sections below highlight current policies that impact higher education access, degree completion, and post-graduate career prospects for international students and scholars.
The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) provides protections to individuals who have fled their countries due to “a well-founded fear of persecution for their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.” The U.S. government selects and vets individuals located overseas to receive protection and come live in the United States. Once the United States selects individuals for resettlement, the government works with non-governmental organizations to integrate refugees into communities across the country. The president in consultation with congress sets the number of refugees the country will receive each year before October 1.
Over 100 million people are displaced worldwide, including 32.5 million refugees as of the end of mid-2022. Of these, only six percent of college-eligible refugees can access higher education. UNHCR has set a goal of fifteen percent of eligible refugees accessing higher education by 2030.
U.S. colleges and universities can and should help reach that goal. However, it is very difficult for refugee students to enter the U.S. as international students since the F-1 visa’s requirement does not match the reality of most refugee students. F-1 applicants must demonstrate their intention to enter the U.S. “temporarily and solely for the purpose” of their academic program and they cannot communicate an interest in transferring to another legal status. If the U.S. pilots a university sponsorship program for refugee students, this can serve as a crucial step toward expanding access to U.S. higher education for refugee students.
Refugees also face other obstacles to accessing higher education, including learning local languages and terms used in academic settings, understanding the new country’s higher education systems, financing their education in the United States, getting institutions to recognize their academic and professional credentials, and integrating into higher education institutions and on-campus life.
Although President Biden has made public commitments to resettle more refugees after several years where the Trump administration significantly lowered these numbers, the administration has not fulfilled them. On May 3, 2021, the administration announced it would raise the refugee cap from the 15,000 individuals the Trump administration set for Fiscal Year 2021 – the lowest point since the program’s inception in 1980 – to 62,500, a move that followed the release of a February 2021 executive order to enhance and rebuild the refugee system. While the administration stated it increased the cap due to emerging refugee emergencies around the world, the United States only received 11,411 individuals that year.
The same pattern occurred for Fiscal Year 2022. On October 8, 2021, the administration announced it would accept 125,000 refugees for Fiscal Year 2022. On September 8, 2022, the administration reported it would only receive between 23,000 to 25,000 individuals, an outcome that has been attributed to the significant resources needed to assist with the reception of Afghans and Ukrainians fleeing violence in their countries. In 2021, the U.S. evacuated 76,000 Afghans and charged the refugee resettlement agencies with providing resettlement services through the Afghan Placement & Assistance (APA) program. Furthermore, over 38,000 have arrived in the U.S. from Ukraine through the Uniting for Ukraine program and another 75,000 are approved for travel. Nevertheless, the administration committed to resettling the same number of individuals for Fiscal Year 2023 on September 27, 2022.
The Biden administration has expanded the ability of private individuals in the United States to assist and resettle refugees and other displaced individuals. In October 2021, the administration introduced the Sponsor Circle for Afghans, a program that allowed a group of individuals to provide financial support for Afghans who were evacuated to the United States during the U.S. Withdrawal from Afghanistan. In January 2023, the administration unveiled the Welcome Corps, which will allow individuals and organizations like universities to support the arrival of refugees admitted through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. The program will eventually allow these entities to refer individuals for admission through the USRAP and assist with their reception. The administration will announce a similar program for higher education institutions in 2023.
Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) are forms of humanitarian protection that provide work permits and protection from deportation for noncitizens who cannot be safely returned to their home country. Over 300,000 individuals are protected under TPS and over 200,000 individuals are protected under DED. 
TPS holders represent students, staff, and faculty at many higher education institutions. TPS also provides the security and financial stability through work permits for individuals to be able to attend and complete their higher education.
Litigation against the Trump administration’s decision to end TPS for most recipients in 2018 may have failed to produce lasting protection for these groups. After President Biden came into office in January 2021, the administration aimed to settle the litigation through a series of negotiations with the plaintiffs’ attorneys, a move that saw it pause the Trump administration’s efforts to challenge these cases in the courts.
On October 27, 2022, however, these talks collapsed after both sides failed to reach an agreement on the scope of protection for these individuals. This development means approximately 337,000 TPS recipients from El Salvador, Nicaragua, Nepal, and Honduras may lose their status depending on whether the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which rejected a lower court ruling against the decision in September 2020, accepts the plaintiffs’ request to rehear the case with the full roster of judges or deny this request. On February 11, 2023, the 9th Circuit announced it would hear the cases with the full roster of judges.
In response to this situation, the Biden administration issued a Federal Register Notice on November 10, 2022 stating that these TPS recipients will retain their status while the preliminary injunction against the decision to end TPS for these groups remains in place. DHS also automatically extended the Employment Authorization Documents and other TPS-related documents for this group through June 30, 2024.

The H-4 work authorization program, introduced in 2015 through executive action, allows certain spouses of H-1B recipients to receive work authorization. Although all spouses of H visa holders must have an H-4 visa to enter the United States, the visa does not provide them with an employment authorization document to legally work in the country. H-4 visa holders can access this benefit to work for any employer if their H-1B spouses have received approval for employment-based green cards but continue to wait for a green card to become available.
H-4 dependents who are children of H-1B visa holders are not eligible to receive work authorization employment.

Congratulations on your decision to study in the United States. Nonimmigrant students who come to the United States to study must follow specific rules. However, different rules apply depending on your student type and education level. Learn what student type and education level applies to you below:
Student Type:
Education Level:

Your first step is to apply to a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school in the United States. Use the School Search tool to find SEVP-certified schools and programs that are eligible to enroll F-1 and M-1 students. For more information about the types of programs that are available to you, please visit EducationUSA.
If you are a student currently enrolled in the equivalent of a kindergarten through grade 12 program, visit the Kindergarten to Grade 12 page on Study in the States.
The Form I-20
Once you are accepted into an SEVP-certified school, your school’s designated school official will send you a document called the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” The Form I-20 is a paper record of your information in our Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) database. Each school that accepts you will mail you a Form I-20.
For more information, visit the Students and the Form I-20 page.
After receiving your Form I-20, you must pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee.
Federal regulations require all F, M and J students pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee before applying for their U.S. student visa. You can pay your I-901 SEVIS Fee online at FMJfee.com or by using Western Union Quick Pay. You must present the receipt as proof of payment when you apply for visa. It’s important that the SEVIS ID number on your I-901 SEVIS Fee receipt matches your SEVIS ID number on your Form I-20. If it does not, or you encounter other issues paying your fee, please contact SEVP.
I-901 SEVIS Fee Assistance:
Learn more about the I-901 SEVIS Fee:
After paying the I-901 SEVIS Fee and getting a receipt, you must apply for a visa at any U.S. Embassy or Consulate before you come to the United States.
To receive a visa, you will have to participate in an in-person interview. During your visa interview, you will need to establish that you meet the requirements under U.S. law to receive the category of visa for which you are applying. The consular officer will determine if you qualify to receive a visa and which visa category is appropriate based on your purpose of travel.
A visa does not guarantee entrance to the United States; it only permits you to arrive and seek permission to enter the country. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the U.S. port of entry has the final authority to admit entry into the country.
The following pages will assist with this process:
Before you leave for the United States, familiarize yourself with the different documents you will need or could need when you arrive. It is also a good idea to make at least two sets of copies of these documents: one copy to leave with your family before you depart and one copy to give to your school officials. Required documents include your:
It is also smart to have your acceptance letter, proof of financial ability and any other supporting documentation with you, in case the Customs and Border Protection officer asks for them. You should carry your original travel documents on you at all times while traveling. Do not put them in your checked baggage. For more information on traveling to the United States, visit the Getting to the United States page.
When you arrive to the United States you will meet a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry, who will verify your information and determine if you may enter the country.
If the officer cannot initially verify your information, or if you do not have all of the required documentation, you may be directed to an interview area known as “secondary inspection.” Secondary inspection allows inspectors to conduct additional research in order to verify information without causing delays for other arriving passengers.
The inspector will first attempt to verify your status by using SEVIS. In the event that the CBP officer needs to verify information with your school or program, we strongly recommend that you have the name and telephone number of the designated school official (DSO) at your school on hand. If you arrive during non-business hours (evening, weekends, holidays), you should also have an emergency or non-business hour phone number available for this official.
Failure to comply with U.S. government entry-exit procedures may result in your being denied entry to the United States. Under certain circumstances, the CBP officer may issue a Form I-515A, “Notice to Student or Exchange Visitor,” which authorizes temporary admission into the United States. Work with your school without delay to submit the proper documentation required by the Form I-515A. Failing to comply with a Form I-515A will result in the termination of your status. Read SEVP’s Form I-515A Noncompliance Termination procedure to ensure you understand how to properly respond and maintain your status.
If the CBP officer admits you into the country, you will be given a Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record.” This form shows that you have been legally admitted into the United States, the class of admission and your authorized period of stay. It is very important that the information on the record is correct. Inconsistencies between the information on the Form I-94 and SEVIS records can reduce the chances of a successful systems interface and can result in denial of benefits or difficulty re-entering the country.
You have 30 days to enter the country before your official program start date, as listed on your Form I-20. If you do not report to your school by your program start date, your DSO may terminate your SEVIS record. We suggest that you contact your school immediately once you enter the country so that there is no question of your arrival.
If you cannot enter the United States for the term listed on your Form I-20, contact your school officials as soon as possible so that they can update your record so your plans are accurately reflected in SEVIS.
As an F or M student, you will often hear the phrase “maintaining status.” Maintaining your status means that you are fulfilling the purpose for why the U.S. Department of State issued you your visa and following the regulations associated with that purpose. Remember, a student visa is a travel document you receive from a U.S. consulate or embassy before you enter the United States. Your student status is what you must maintain after you are granted entrance into the United States. Learn more about the rules you must follow by talking to your DSO and reviewing the Maintaining Status page on Study in the States.
While studying in the United States, you may be eligible to apply for certain benefits. These student benefits are not granted by SEVP and require students to apply to other government agencies to receive them. The benefits you are eligible for will depend on your student status. Visit the following pages to learn more about potential student benefits:
As a note, most employment and training opportunities require authorization from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). For more information, visit the Employment page on ICE.gov.
If you are having an immediate problem and need assistance quickly, please speak with your DSO or responsible officer. If that person cannot help you, contact the SEVP Response Center at 1-703-603-3400 or at SEVP@ice.dhs.gov.
Once you have completed your program and fulfilled your purpose for coming to the United States, you may have a number of options. These include changing your status, applying for training, transferring to another SEVP-certified school or leaving the country.
Please note there are restrictions that apply to M-1 students regarding transferring and changing status. Talk to your DSO to understand what your options are.
If after your program is complete you do not qualify to stay in the country, or chose to depart, please be advised:
You can also visit USCIS to learn about naturalization and the path to U.S. citizenship.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is issuing policy guidance regarding the F and M student nonimmigrant classifications, including the agency’s role in adjudicating applications for employment authorization, change of status, extension of stay, and reinstatement of status for these students and their dependents in the United States.
This guidance consolidates existing policy. USCIS expects that this will provide welcome clarity to international students and U.S. educational institutions on a wealth of topics, including eligibility requirements, school transfers, practical training, and on- and off-campus employment.
For example, the guidance clarifies that F and M students must have a foreign residence that they do not intend to abandon, but that such students may be the beneficiary of a permanent labor certification application or immigrant visa petition and may still be able to demonstrate their intention to depart after a temporary period of stay.
In addition, the guidance specifies how F students seeking an extension of optional practical training (OPT) based on their degree in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field may be employed by startup companies, as long as the employer adheres to the training plan requirements, remains in good standing with E-Verify, and provides compensation commensurate to that provided to similarly situated U.S. workers, among other requirements.
The nonimmigrant academic student (F-1) classification allows a noncitizen to enter the United States as a full-time student at a college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution, or in a language training program. The nonimmigrant vocational student (M-1) classification includes students in established vocational or other recognized nonacademic programs, other than language training programs.
For more information about the USCIS guidance, see the Policy Alert (PDF, 312.06 KB) and Volume 2, Part F of the Policy Manual. For more information about the role of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in administering these nonimmigrant student programs, see the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS).

Student Visa


Exchange Visitor Visa


Generally, a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.
While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa.  However, once you depart the United States you must apply for a new visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.

There is no guarantee you will be issued a visa. Do not make final travel plans or buy tickets until you have a visa.
For information about working in the United States during your study, review Students and Employment and Form I-765 Work Authorization Instructions on the USCIS website.
If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.

Foreign Students in the United States: Policies and ...,,https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RL31146.pdf,Not Found,Not Found
New USCIS Policies for International Students & Companies,"Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has updated its policy guidance for F and M student visas, consolidating various rules into one clear document to reduce confusion and increase transparency for students and businesses. This includes clarifications on maintaining foreign residence while pursuing permanent residency, and new options for F-1 STEM students to work with startups during their Optional Practical Training (OPT) extensions.
The guidance addresses key areas such as employment authorization, change of status, extension of stay, and reinstatement of status for F and M students and their dependents in the United States.
The updated guidance emphasizes that F and M students must maintain a foreign residence and not intend to permanently abandon their home country.
Despite this, the policy now allows students to apply for permanent residency through green cards in the U.S. It’s crucial for students to demonstrate their intention to return to their home country after their temporary stay in the U.S., even as they explore long-term options.
For F-1 students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, the policy update is particularly noteworthy. It offers an extension of Optional Practical Training (OPT) for those seeking employment opportunities with startup companies.
The startups must comply with specific requirements: they need to adhere to the outlined training plans, be in good standing with E-Verify, and provide compensation that is on par with similarly situated U.S. workers. This creates new employment opportunities but also requires students and their employers to be vigilant about meeting these conditions.
USCIS has provided detailed explanations regarding the maintenance of student status. This includes comprehensive guidance on transferring schools, exploring different employment options while on a student visa, and the procedures for applying for various benefits.
The clearer guidelines help students understand their responsibilities and rights under their visa status. However, it also means that students need to be more proactive in ensuring their activities and employment align with these updated rules to maintain their legal status in the U.S.
While the policy update offers greater flexibility and opens up new avenues, it’s essential for students to plan their future in the U.S. with these regulations in mind.
Whether it’s considering long-term residency or seeking employment post-graduation, students should factor in these updated guidelines in their decision-making process.
IMPORTANT: With these changes, the onus is on the students to stay informed and compliant with the updated policies. This involves regularly checking for any new updates or changes in immigration policies that might affect their status.

“Understanding and adapting to the USCIS’s new policy guidance is crucial for employers seeking to tap into the rich pool of international talent. This guidance not only opens up new avenues for hiring bright minds, especially in the STEM fields, but also brings a responsibility to ensure compliance with the nuanced requirements,” said Hendrik Pretorius, Immigration Attorney and Director of Account Management at Boundless. “As companies navigate these changes, it’s important to strike a balance between leveraging global talent and adhering to the intricate landscape of immigration policies. Proactive engagement and informed strategies will be key to harnessing the potential of international students in a way that benefits both the students and the growth of our companies.”
USCIS’s revised policy guidance is a pivotal development for both F and M international students and U.S. employers. It aims to simplify and clarify the complexities of student visa categories, providing a clearer path for students pursuing education and career opportunities in the United States. For students, it opens doors to new opportunities, particularly in STEM fields, and delineates the conditions under which they can pursue permanent residency while on a student visa. Employers stand to benefit from a broader pool of international talent, especially in specialized STEM areas, with the added responsibility of ensuring compliance with the specific requirements of the OPT program. This guidance symbolizes a stride towards a more integrated and supportive framework for international students and the companies that seek to employ them, fostering an environment of growth, innovation, and mutual benefit. As we navigate these changes, the importance of staying informed, adhering to legal requirements, and seeking expert advice cannot be overstated, ensuring that the potential of these policies is fully realized for the enrichment of both international students and the American workforce.

International Students in the United States,"International students wave their country flags at a Northeastern University commencement ceremony. (Photo: U.S. State Department)
The United States has long been the top receiving country for international students, who historically have been drawn by the high quality of U.S. higher education, its value on the international labor market, and access to job opportunities in the United States after graduation. About 1.1 million international students were enrolled in U.S. institutions in school year (SY) 2019-20. This marked a decrease of almost 20,000 international students from the year before, following a decade of consistent growth. Among the key factors for this decline were the rising cost of U.S. higher education, high numbers of student visa delays and denials, a difficult political environment for immigrants under the Trump administration, and expanded opportunities to study in other countries.
The COVID-19 pandemic has further aggravated these dynamics. Closures and limited access to U.S. embassies and consulates, travel restrictions, and personal safety considerations have complicated visa issuance and travel plans of international students. The Trump administration initially attempted to bar students from entering or remaining in the United States if their schools offered only online courses, although the order was quickly rescinded. Still, the move contributed to confusion and frustration for U.S. colleges and universities and their international students. At the start of the fall 2020 academic semester, the total number of international students enrolled in U.S. schools, including those physically present in the United States and studying online from abroad, decreased by 16 percent from the previous year. One in five of these students was studying online from another country. The number of new international students fell by 43 percent, in part because some chose to defer their studies.
Using data from the Institute of International Education (IIE) and NAFSA: Association of International Educators, this Spotlight examines characteristics of international students who were enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities in SY 2019-20, focusing on the population’s size, geographic distribution, top institutions, countries of origin, levels and fields of study, economic impact, and transition into the U.S. labor market. Data on international students in the United States include those who were enrolled in educational institutions as well as graduates who remained on a student visa for Optional Practical Training (OPT), a period lasting from 12 to 36 months depending on the student’s field of study.  
Click on the bullet points below for more information:
Visa Categories
U.S. immigration law has four categories of visas for foreign students and exchange visitors:
Students holding an F-1 visa are authorized for up to 12 months of OPT upon graduation and become eligible for another year of OPT when seeking a further postsecondary degree at a higher level. Students with a degree in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) are eligible for an OPT extension of up to 24 additional months. Once the OPT period ends, graduates must find an employer willing to sponsor them for a work visa (such as an H-1B visa) in order to continue working in the United States. Spouses and children of foreign students and exchange visitors can enter the country by obtaining an F-2, M-2, or J-2 visa (depending on the visa category of the student or visitor they are accompanying), though only J-2 holders are eligible to study or work in the United States without obtaining their own student or work visa. After they complete their academic or research programs, international students and exchange visitors may remain in the United States if they are eligible for family- and employer-sponsored green cards, the K-1 visa for fiancé(e)s of U.S. citizens, and some nonimmigrant visas.
In the wake of the discovery that one of the 9/11 hijackers had entered the United States on a student visa but never attended class, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003 implemented a program to collect, maintain, and manage information about all foreign students and exchange visitors in the United States. The program, called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), tracks and monitors schools, programs, students, exchange visitors, and their dependents throughout the duration of approved participation in the U.S. education system. As part of SEVIS, all schools are required to submit and regularly update student information in a central database that can be accessed by the government; students who do not appear or who stop attending classes can have their visas revoked and face deportation.
More than 1.5 million F-1 and M-1 students were enrolled in SEVIS-certified schools in calendar year 2019, down by approximately 2 percent from 2018. At the same time, the number of J-1 visiting students increased by 2 percent from 2018 to 2019, to nearly 533,000. There were more than 8,600 SEVIS-certified schools in calendar year 2019, slightly fewer than in recent years.
The following sections focus specifically on international students who were either enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities or participating in OPT. Estimates are based on an annual survey of U.S. schools conducted by IIE, which are slightly different from SEVIS estimates.
Enrollment Numbers and Trends
The number of international students enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities has experienced strong overall growth since the 1950s (see Figure 1). Beginning with just 26,000 international students in the 1949-50 school year, the number of students neared 1.1 million in 2019-20. International students also increased as a share of all students enrolled in U.S. higher education: from 1 percent in 1949–50 to nearly 6 percent in 2019-20.
Figure 1. International Students and Share of Total Enrollment (%), School Year (SY) 1949-50 to 2019-20
Source: Institute of International Education (IIE), ""Enrollment Trends: International Student Data from the 2020 Open Doors Report,” accessed January 11, 2021, available online.
Growth has slowed in the last decade, however, and the 2019-20 school year saw the first decline in years in the overall number of international students in the United States (see Figure 2). New students have comprised a falling share of all international students, down from 29 percent in SY 2009-10 to 25 percent in 2019-20. Over the same period, the share of students participating in OPT has more than doubled, from 10 percent to 21 percent.

Sources: IIE, ""Enrollment Trends: International Student Data from the 2020 Open Doors Report”; IIE, “New International Student Enrollment: International Student Data from the 2020 Open Doors Report,” accessed January 11, 2021, available online.
The number of international students newly enrolling at U.S. institutions dropped in 2016-17 and has decreased each year since (see Figure 3). In the 2019-20 school year, 268,000 new international students were enrolled in U.S. institutions.
Figure 3. Annual Change in New International Student Enrollment (%), Fall 2009-19
Source: IIE, ""New International Student Enrollment: International Student Data from the 2020 Open Doors Report.”
A 2018 survey of staff at more than 500 U.S. higher education institutions explored reasons for the enrollment declines. Respondents cited a variety of factors including visa difficulties, the U.S. social and political climate, competition from other countries’ institutions, and the costs of attending U.S. colleges and universities. The share of respondents pointing to the visa application process has grown the fastest, from 34 percent in 2016 to 83 percent in 2018. Notably, this survey was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic and related travel and visa difficulties. Concerns about the social and political environment was the second fastest-growing reason, rising from 15 percent of respondents to 60 percent between 2016 and 2018.
Geographic Distribution and Leading Institutions
In SY 2019-20, one in three international students studied in California, New York, or Texas (see Table 1). Other leading host states were Massachusetts, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. International students are more evenly spread out across the country than the overall U.S. foreign-born population; for instance, California is home to about 15 percent of international students but accounts for about 24 percent of the total immigrant population.

New York University has been the leading host university for international students since SY 2013–14. Northeastern University-Boston rose to the second spot in the 2019-20 school year, pushing the University of Southern California out of the position it had held since the 2013-14 school year. Nationally, ten institutions enrolled more than 11,000 international students each in SY 2019-20 (see Table 2).

Source: IIE, “Leading Host Institutions: International Student Data from the 2020 Open Doors Report,” accessed January 11, 2021, available online.
Countries of Origin
In SY 2019-20, China was the top origin for international students, representing 35 percent of the total, followed by India (18 percent), South Korea (5 percent), and Saudi Arabia (3 percent). While the overall growth in the number of international students has stalled, there continue to be year-over-year increases in the number of Chinese studying in the United States. Together with Taiwan and Brazil, China is one of only three origin countries in the top ten from which the number of international students increased from SY 2018-19 to SY 2019-20.
India and South Korea saw respective declines of 4 percent and 5 percent in SY 2019-20, while Saudi Arabia saw the largest decrease of the top ten countries, with 17 percent fewer students than in SY 2018-19 (a reflection of that country’s reduced financial assistance for its students to study abroad). Of the top 25 countries of origin, Spain and Bangladesh saw the largest increase in the number of students, rising 10 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Despite that growth, each country still accounted for less than 1 percent of all international students in U.S. higher education.
The origin-country composition of international students has changed significantly over time (see Table 3). In SY 1949–50, Canada, Taiwan, India, and several European and Latin American countries were the major sending countries to U.S. institutions. Following the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which removed national-origin quotas, students from Asia have made up a larger share of international student enrollment.

Source: IIE, “All Places of Origin: International Student Data from the 2020 Open Doors Report,” accessed January 11, 2021, available online.
Fields of Study
Engineering, math and computer science, and business and management were the top three fields of study for international students in SY 2019-20, accounting for more than half of all international enrollment at U.S. higher education institutions (see Figure 4). Notably, 52 percent of international students were in STEM fields and were eligible for the extended 36-month OPT upon graduation.
Between SYs 2018-19 and 2019-20, just two fields of study experienced growth in their overall international enrollment: Fine and applied arts (2 percent) and math and computer science (1 percent). The remaining fields kept roughly the same level of international student enrollment or experienced declines. The largest drop was in education (6 percent), followed by agriculture, business and management, and engineering (about 4 percent or 5 percent each).
Figure 4. Fields of Study of International Students, SY 2019-20
Note: Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields are denoted with *.Source: IIE, “Fields of Study: International Student Data from the 2020 Open Doors Report,” accessed January 11, 2021, available online.
Students from different origin countries tend to pursue different majors. For instance, most students from Iran (80 percent), India (78 percent), Nepal (70 percent), and Nigeria (62 percent) in SY 2019-20 were in STEM fields, versus just 18 percent of those from Japan, and 23 percent each of those from the United Kingdom and Germany.
Academic Levels
From SYs 1979–80 to 2019-20, international enrollment has steadily risen for all academic levels except for non-degree students. In SY 2019-20, undergraduate international students outnumbered graduate students (see Figure 5).
Figure 5. Academic Level of International Students, SY 1979–80 to 2019-20
Source: IIE, “Academic Level: International Student Data from the 2020 Open Doors Report,” accessed January 11, 2021, available online.
Funding and Economic Impact
In SY 2019-20, about 60 percent of international students received most of their educational funding from sources outside the United States: 56 percent relied on personal and family funding, and another 4 percent primarily used foreign government or foreign university aid. The remaining 40 percent financed their education primarily through current employment, U.S. university aid, or other sources.
International students contributed nearly $39 billion to the U.S. economy and created or supported 416,000 jobs, according to NAFSA estimates.
Transition into U.S. Labor Market 
Post-graduation, availability of work visas is the main barrier to international students wishing to retain work in the United States. A 2014 Brookings Institution report found that 45 percent of foreign student graduates were able to extend their visas to work in the same metropolitan area as their college or university.
The number of international students remaining after their studies through the OPT program has increased, although growth has slowed in recent years. In SY 2019-20, there were slightly more than 223,500 people in the OPT program, an increase of fewer than 500 from the previous year.
Guided by its focus to reduce immigration across virtually all streams, the Trump administration made it harder for the foreign born, including international students, to enter or remain in the United States on either temporary or permanent visas. In contrast, the incoming Biden administration has promised to expand the number of highly skilled visas, reduce visa backlogs, and speed up visa and citizenship application processing. The change in rhetoric and new policy directions may help reverse enrollment declines and expand post-graduation opportunities for international students, depending on the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

International Student U.S. Visa Information,"
Jump to navigation


In the United States, there are three primary student visa types: F, J, and M. 
Visa Types
Valid student visas are required to apply to the Department of Homeland Security for admission into the United States at the port of entry. Students' Form I-20 document (F and M visas) or DS-2019 document (J visas), that are issued by their institution, is what allows them to maintain student status in the United States even if a visa expires during their studies. To issue I-20 or DS-2019 documentation for student visas, U.S. institutions must be certified by the Department of Homeland Security SEVP (Student and Exchange Visitor Program) (F, M visas) or designated by the Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (J visas), respectively. 
Although an institution certified by SEVP to issue I-20s (F, M visas), the institution may not hold national or regional accreditation. Recognition of course credits and degrees by other institutions and by U.S. and international employers is linked to an institution's accreditation. The U.S. Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation databases list all U.S. institutions' accreditation. Note that institutions designated by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to place participants in Academic Exchange programs (J visas) must be accredited.
Two separate U.S. government agencies manage international student arrival and status while studying in the United States. The U.S. Department of State is responsible for the initial visa application process and issuance. Once a visa holder arrives in the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then acts as the responsible agency for granting entry into the country, as well as enforcing immigration regulations that affect international students once they are in the United States.

(ii) Section 101(a)(15)(C) is divided into (C)(i) for aliens who are not diplomats and are in transit through the United States; (C)(ii) for aliens in transit to and from the United Nations Headquarters District; and (C)(iii) for alien diplomats in transit through the United States;
(iii) Section 101(a)(15)(H) is divided to create an (H)(iv) subclassification for the spouse and children of a nonimmigrant classified under section 101(a)(15) (H) (i), (ii), or (iii);
(iv) Section 101(a)(15)(J) is divided into (J)(i) for principal aliens and (J)(ii) for such alien's spouse and children;
(v) Section 101(a)(15)(K) is divided into (K)(i) for the fianceé(e), (K)(ii) for the spouse, and (K)(iii) for the children of either;
(vi) Section 101(a)(15)(L) is divided into (L)(i) for principal aliens and (L)(ii) for such alien's spouse and children;
(vii) Section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii) is divided to create a (Q)(iii) for subclassification for the spouse and children of a nonimmigrant classified under section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii) of the Act;
(viii) Section 101(a)(15)(T)(ii) is divided into (T)(ii), (T)(iii) and (T)(iv) for the spouse, child, and parent, respectively, of a nonimmigrant classified under section 101(a)(15)(T)(i); and
(ix) Section 101(a)(15)(U)(ii) is divided into (U)(ii), (U)(iii), (U)(iv), and (U)(v) for the spouse, child, parent, and siblings, respectively, of a nonimmigrant classified under section 101(a)(15)(U)(i); and
(2) Classification designations. For the purpose of this chapter the following nonimmigrant designations are established. The designation in the second column may be used to refer to the appropriate nonimmigrant classification.

(3) General requirements. (i) Every nonimmigrant alien who applies for admission to, or an extension of stay in, the United States, must establish that he or she is admissible to the United States, or that any ground of inadmissibility has been waived under section 212(d)(3) of the Act. Upon application for admission, the alien must present a valid passport and valid visa unless either or both documents have been waived. A nonimmigrant alien's admission to the United States is conditioned on compliance with any inspection requirement in §235.1(d) or of this chapter. The passport of an alien applying for admission must be valid for a minimum of six months from the expiration date of the contemplated period of stay, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, and the alien must agree to abide by the terms and conditions of his or her admission. An alien applying for extension of stay must present a passport only if requested to do so by the Department of Homeland Security. The passport of an alien applying for extension of stay must be valid at the time of application for extension, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, and the alien must agree to maintain the validity of his or her passport and to abide by all the terms and conditions of his extension.
(ii) At the time of admission or extension of stay, every nonimmigrant alien must also agree to depart the United States at the expiration of his or her authorized period of admission or extension of stay, or upon abandonment of his or her authorized nonimmigrant status, and to comply with the departure procedures at section 215.8 of this chapter if such procedures apply to the particular alien. The nonimmigrant alien's failure to comply with those departure requirements, including any requirement that the alien provide biometric identifiers, may constitute a failure of the alien to maintain the terms of his or her nonimmigrant status.
(iii) At the time a nonimmigrant alien applies for admission or extension of stay, he or she must post a bond on Form I-352 in the sum of not less than $500, to ensure the maintenance of his or her nonimmigrant status and departure from the United States, if required to do so by the Commissioner of CBP, the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an immigration judge, or the Board of Immigration Appeals.
(b) Readmission of nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15) (F), (J), (M), or (Q)(ii) to complete unexpired periods of previous admission or extension of stay—(1) Section 101(a)(15)(F). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for duration of status as defined in §214.2(f)(5)(iii), any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(F) of the Act, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United States not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory or adjacent islands;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the requirement for presentation of a passport; and
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, an Arrival-Departure Record, Form I-94 (see §1.4), issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay, the alien's Form I-20 ID copy, and either:
(A) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20A-B if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20A since the form was initially issued; or
(B) A new Form I-20A-B if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20A since the form was initially issued.
(2) Section 101(a)(15)(J). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's departure, any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United States not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory or adjacent islands;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the requirement for the presentation of a passport; and
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, Form I-94 issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay or copy three of the last Form IAP-66 issued to the alien. Form I-94 or Form IAP-66 must show the unexpired period of the alien's stay endorsed by the Service.
(3) Section 101(a)(15)(M). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's departure, any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(M) of the Act, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the requirement for presentation of a passport; and
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, Form I-94 issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay, the alien's Form I-20 ID copy, and a properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N.
(4) Section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's departure, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United States not exceeding 30 days solely in contiguous territory or adjacent islands;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport;
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, an Arrival-Departure Record, Form I-94, issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay. The principal alien must also present a Certification Letter issued by the Department of State's Program Administrator.
(c) Extensions of stay—(1) Filing on Form I-129. An employer seeking the services of an E-1, E-2, H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, H-3, L-1, O-1, O-2, P-1, P-2, P-3, Q-1, R-1, or TN nonimmigrant beyond the period previously granted, must petition for an extension of stay on Form I-129. The petition must be filed with the fee required in §103.7 of this chapter, and the initial evidence specified in §214.2, and on the petition form. Dependents holding derivative status may be included in the petition if it is for only one worker and the form version specifically provides for their inclusion. In all other cases dependents of the worker should file on Form I-539.
(2) Filing on Form I-539. Any other nonimmigrant alien, except an alien in F or J status who has been granted duration of status, who seeks to extend his or her stay beyond the currently authorized period of admission, must apply for an extension of stay on Form I-539 with the fee required in §103.7 of this chapter together with any initial evidence specified in the applicable provisions of §214.2, and on the application form. More than one person may be included in an application where the co-applicants are all members of a single family group and either all hold the same nonimmigrant status or one holds a nonimmigrant status and the other co-applicants are his or her spouse and/or children who hold derivative nonimmigrant status based on his or her status. Extensions granted to members of a family group must be for the same period of time. The shortest period granted to any member of the family shall be granted to all members of the family. In order to be eligible for an extension of stay, nonimmigrant aliens in K-3/K-4 status must do so in accordance with §214.2(k)(10).
(3) Ineligible for extension of stay. A nonimmigrant in any of the following classes is ineligible for an extension of stay:
(i) B-1 or B-2 where admission was pursuant to the Visa Waiver Pilot Program;
(ii) C-1, C-2, C-3;
(iii) D-1, D-2;
(iv) K-1, K-2;
(v) Any nonimmigrant admitted for duration of status, other than as provided in §214.2(f)(7);
(vi) Any nonimmigrant who is classified pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act beyond a total of 3 years; or
(vii) Any nonimmigrant who is classified according to section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii) of the Act beyond a total of 3 years.
(viii) Any nonimmigrant admitted pursuant to the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program, as provided in section 212(l) of the Act.
(4) Timely filing and maintenance of status. An extension of stay may not be approved for an applicant who failed to maintain the previously accorded status or where such status expired before the application or petition was filed, except that failure to file before the period of previously authorized status expired may be excused in the discretion of the Service and without separate application, with any extension granted from the date the previously authorized stay expired, where it is demonstrated at the time of filing that:
(i) The delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the applicant or petitioner, and the Service finds the delay commensurate with the circumstances;
(ii) The alien has not otherwise violated his or her nonimmigrant status;
(iii) The alien remains a bona fide nonimmigrant; and
(iv) The alien is not the subject of deportation proceedings under section 242 of the Act (prior to April 1, 1997) or removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act.
(5) Decision in Form I-129 or I-539 extension proceedings. Where an applicant or petitioner demonstrates eligibility for a requested extension, it may be granted at the discretion of the Service. There is no appeal from the denial of an application for extension of stay filed on Form I-129 or I-539.
(d) Termination of status. Within the period of initial admission or extension of stay, the nonimmigrant status of an alien shall be terminated by the revocation of a waiver authorized on his or her behalf under section 212(d) (3) or (4) of the Act; by the introduction of a private bill to confer permanent resident status on such alien; or, pursuant to notification in the Federal Register, on the basis of national security, diplomatic, or public safety reasons.
(e) Employment. A nonimmigrant in the United States in a class defined in section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Act as a temporary visitor for pleasure, or section 101(a)(15)(C) of the Act as an alien in transit through this country, may not engage in any employment. Any other nonimmigrant in the United States may not engage in any employment unless he has been accorded a nonimmigrant classification which authorizes employment or he has been granted permission to engage in employment in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. A nonimmigrant who is permitted to engage in employment may engage only in such employment as has been authorized. Any unauthorized employment by a nonimmigrant constitutes a failure to maintain status within the meaning of section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
(f) Registration and false information. A nonimmigrant's admission and continued stay in the United States is conditioned on compliance with any registration, photographing, and fingerprinting requirements under §264.1(f) of this chapter that relate to the maintenance of nonimmigrant status and also on the full and truthful disclosure of all information requested by the Service. Willful failure by a nonimmigrant to register or to provide full and truthful information requested by the Service (regardless of whether or not the information requested was material) constitutes a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status under section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)).
(g) Criminal activity. A condition of a nonimmigrant's admission and continued stay in the United States is obedience to all laws of United States jurisdictions which prohibit the commission of crimes of violence and for which a sentence of more than one year imprisonment may be imposed. A nonimmigrant's conviction in a jurisdiction in the United States for a crime of violence for which a sentence of more than one year imprisonment may be imposed (regardless of whether such sentence is in fact imposed) constitutes a failure to maintain status under section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
(h) Education privacy and F, J, and M nonimmigrants. As authorized by section 641(c)(2) of Division C of Pub. L. 104-208, 8 U.S.C. 1372, and §2.1(a) of this chapter, the Service has determined that, with respect to F and M nonimmigrant students and J nonimmigrant exchange visitors, waiving the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. 1232g, is necessary for the proper implementation of 8 U.S.C. 1372. An educational agency or institution may not refuse to report information concerning an F or M nonimmigrant student or a J nonimmigrant exchange visitor that the educational agency or institution is required to report under 8 U.S.C. 1372 and §214.3(g) (or any corresponding Department of State regulation concerning J nonimmigrants) on the basis of FERPA and any regulation implementing FERPA. The waiver of FERPA under this paragraph authorizes and requires an educational agency or institution to report information concerning an F, J or M nonimmigrant that would ordinarily be protected by FERPA, but only to the extent that 8 U.S.C. 1372 and §214.3(g) (or any corresponding Department of State regulation concerning J nonimmigrants) requires the educational agency or institution to report information.
(i) Employment in a health care occupation. (1) Except as provided in 8 CFR 212.15(n), any alien described in 8 CFR 212.15(a) who is coming to the United States to perform labor in a health care occupation described in 8 CFR 212.15(c) must obtain a certificate from a credentialing organization described in 8 CFR 212.15(e). The certificate or certified statement must be presented to the Department of Homeland Security in accordance with 8 CFR 212.15(d). In the alternative, an eligible alien seeking admission as a nurse may obtain a certified statement as provided in 8 CFR 212.15(h).
(2) A TN nonimmigrant may establish that he or she is eligible for a waiver described at 8 CFR 212.15(n) by providing evidence that his or her initial admission as a TN (or TC) nonimmigrant health care worker occurred before September 23, 2003, and he or she was licensed and employed in the United States as a health care worker before September 23, 2003. Evidence may include, but is not limited to, copies of TN or TC approval notices, copies of Form I-94 Arrival/Departure Records, employment verification letters and/or pay-stubs or other employment records, and state health care worker licenses.
(j) Extension of stay or change of status for health care worker. In the case of any alien admitted temporarily as a nonimmigrant under section 212(d)(3) of the Act and 8 CFR 212.15(n) for the primary purpose of the providing labor in a health care occupation described in 8 CFR 212.15(c), the petitioning employer may file a Form I-129 to extend the approval period for the alien's classification for the nonimmigrant status. If the alien is in the United States and is eligible for an extension of stay or change of status, the Form I-129 also serves as an application to extend the period of the alien's authorized stay or to change the alien's status. Although the Form I-129 petition may be approved, as it relates to the employer's request to classify the alien, the application for an extension of stay or change of status shall be denied if:
(1) The petitioner or applicant fails to submit the certification required by 8 CFR 212.15(a) with the petition or application to extend the alien's stay or change the alien's status; or
(2) The petition or application to extend the alien's stay or change the alien's status does include the certification required by 8 CFR 212.15(a), but the alien obtained the certification more than 1 year after the date of the alien's admission under section 212(d)(3) of the Act and 8 CFR 212.15(n). While DHS may admit, extend the period of authorized stay, or change the status of a nonimmigrant health care worker for a period of 1 year if the alien does not have certification on or before July 26, 2004 (or on or before July 26, 2005, in the case of a citizen of Canada or Mexico, who, before September 23, 2003, was employed as a TN or TC nonimmigrant health care worker and held a valid license from a U.S. jurisdiction), the alien will not be eligible for a subsequent admission, change of status, or extension of stay as a health care worker if the alien has not obtained the requisite certification 1 year after the initial date of admission, change of status, or extension of stay as a health care worker.
(k) Denial of petitions under section 214(c) of the Act based on a finding by the Department of Labor. Upon debarment by the Department of Labor pursuant to 20 CFR part 655, USCIS may deny any petition filed by that petitioner for nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(H) (except for status under sections 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1)), (L), (O), and (P)(i) of the Act) for a period of at least 1 year but not more than 5 years. The length of the period shall be based on the severity of the violation or violations. The decision to deny petitions, the time period for the bar to petitions, and the reasons for the time period will be explained in a written notice to the petitioner.

(f) Students in colleges, universities, seminaries, conservatories, academic high schools, elementary schools, other academic institutions, and in language training programs—(1) Admission of student—(i) Eligibility for admission. A nonimmigrant student may be admitted into the United States in nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(F) of the Act, if:
(A) The student presents a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in his or her own name by a school approved by the Service for attendance by F-1 foreign students. (In the alternative, for a student seeking admission prior to August 1, 2003, the student may present a currently-valid Form I-20A-B/I-20ID, if that form was issued by the school prior to January 30, 2003);
(B) The student has documentary evidence of financial support in the amount indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20A-B/I-20ID);
(C) For students seeking initial admission only, the student intends to attend the school specified in the student's visa (or, where the student is exempt from the requirement for a visa, the school indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20A-B/I-20ID)); and
(D) In the case of a student who intends to study at a public secondary school, the student has demonstrated that he or she has reimbursed the local educational agency that administers the school for the full, unsubsidized per capita cost of providing education at the school for the period of the student's attendance.
(ii) Disposition of Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID. Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID contains two copies, the I-20 School Copy and the I-20 ID (Student) Copy. For purposes of clarity, the entire Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID shall be referred to as Form I-20 A-B and the I-20 ID (Student) Copy shall be referred to as the I-20 ID. When an F-1 student applies for admission with a complete Form I-20 A-B, the inspecting officer shall:
(A) Transcribe the student's admission number from Form I-94 onto his or her Form I-20 A-B (for students seeking initial admission only);
(B) Endorse all copies of the Form I-20 A-B;
(C) Return the I-20 ID to the student; and
(D) Forward the I-20 School Copy to the Service's processing center for data entry. (The school copy of Form I-20 A-B will be sent back to the school as a notice of the student's admission after data entry.)
(iii) Use of SEVIS. On January 30, 2003, the use of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) will become mandatory for the issuance of any new Form I-20. A student or dependent who presents a non-SEVIS Form I-20 issued on or after January 30, 2003, will not be accepted for admission to the United States. Non-SEVIS Forms I-20 issued prior to January 30, 2003, will continue to be acceptable until August 1, 2003. However, schools must issue a SEVIS Form I-20 to any current student requiring a reportable action (e.g., extension of status, practical training, and requests for employment authorization) or a new Form I-20, or for any aliens who must obtain a new nonimmigrant student visa. As of August 1, 2003, the records of all current or continuing students must be entered in SEVIS.
(2) I-20 ID. An F-1 student is expected to safekeep the initial I-20 ID bearing the admission number and any subsequent copies which have been issued to him or her. Should the student lose his or her current I-20 ID, a replacement copy bearing the same information as the lost copy, including any endorsement for employment and notations, may be issued by the designated school official (DSO) as defined in 8 CFR 214.3(l)(1)(i).
(3) Admission of the spouse and minor children of an F-1 student. The spouse and minor children accompanying an F-1 student are eligible for admission in F-2 status if the student is admitted in F-1 status. The spouse and minor children following-to-join an F-1 student are eligible for admission to the United States in F-2 status if they are able to demonstrate that the F-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study, or engaged in approved practical training following completion of studies. In either case, at the time they seek admission, the eligible spouse and minor children of an F-1 student with a SEVIS Form I-20 must individually present an original SEVIS Form I-20 issued in the name of each F-2 dependent issued by a school authorized by the Service for attendance by F-1 foreign students. Prior to August 1, 2003, if exigent circumstances are demonstrated, the Service will allow the dependent of an F-1 student in possession of a SEVIS Form I-20 to enter the United States using a copy of the F-1 student's SEVIS Form I-20. (In the alternative, for dependents seeking admission to the United States prior to August 1, 2003, a copy of the F-1 student's current Form I-20ID issued prior to January 30, 2003, with proper endorsement by the DSO will satisfy this requirement.) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or Form I-20A-B) is required for a dependent where there has been any substantive change in the F-1 student's current information.
(4) Temporary absence. An F-1 student returning to the United States from a temporary absence of five months or less may be readmitted for attendance at a Service-approved educational institution, if the student presents:
(i) A current SEVIS Form I-20 (or, for readmission prior to August 1, 2003, a current Form I-20ID which was issued prior to January 30, 2003), properly endorsed by the DSO for reentry if there has been no substantive change to the most recent Form I-20 information; or
(ii) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or, for readmission prior to August 1, 2003, a new Form I-20ID which was issued prior to January 30, 2003), if there has been a substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20 information, such as in the case of a student who has changed the major area of study, who intends to transfer to another Service approved institution or who has advanced to a higher level of study.
(5) Duration of status—(i) General. Except for border commuter students covered by the provisions of paragraph (f)(18) of this section, an F-1 student is admitted for duration of status. Duration of status is defined as the time during which an F-1 student is pursuing a full course of study at an educational institution approved by the Service for attendance by foreign students, or engaging in authorized practical training following completion of studies, except that an F-1 student who is admitted to attend a public high school is restricted to an aggregate of 12 months of study at any public high school(s). An F-1 student may be admitted for a period up to 30 days before the indicated report date or program start date listed on Form I-20. The student is considered to be maintaining status if he or she is making normal progress toward completing a course of study.

(ii) Change in educational levels. An F-1 student who continues from one educational level to another is considered to be maintaining status, provided that the transition to the new educational level is accomplished according to transfer procedures outlined in paragraph (f)(8) of this section.
(iii) Annual vacation. An F-1 student at an academic institution is considered to be in status during the annual (or summer) vacation if the student is eligible and intends to register for the next term. A student attending a school on a quarter or trimester calendar who takes only one vacation a year during any one of the quarters or trimesters instead of during the summer is considered to be in status during that vacation, if the student has completed the equivalent of an academic year prior to taking the vacation.
(iv) Preparation for departure. An F-1 student who has completed a course of study and any authorized practical training following completion of studies will be allowed an additional 60-day period to prepare for departure from the United States or to transfer in accordance with paragraph (f)(8) of this section. An F-1 student authorized by the DSO to withdraw from classes will be allowed a 15-day period for departure from the United States. However, an F-1 student who fails to maintain a full course of study without the approval of the DSO or otherwise fails to maintain status is not eligible for an additional period for departure.
(v) Emergent circumstances as determined by the Commissioner. Where the Commissioner has suspended the applicability of any or all of the requirements for on-campus or off-campus employment authorization for specified students pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9)(i) or (f)(9)(ii) of this section by notice in the Federal Register, an affected student who needs to reduce his or her full course of study as a result of accepting employment authorized by such notice in the Federal Register will be considered to be in status during the authorized employment, subject to any other conditions specified in the notice, provided that, for the duration of the authorized employment, the student is registered for the number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term specified in the notice, which in no event shall be less than 6 semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term if the student is at the undergraduate level or less than 3 semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term if the student is at the graduate level, and is continuing to make progress toward completing the course of study.
(vi) Extension of duration of status and grant of employment authorization.
(A) The duration of status, and any employment authorization granted under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B) and (C), of an F-1 student who is the beneficiary of an H-1B petition and request for change of status shall be automatically extended until October 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1B visa is being requested where such petition:
(1) Has been timely filed; and
(2) States that the employment start date for the F-1 student is October 1 of the following fiscal year.
(B) The automatic extension of an F-1 student's duration of status and employment authorization under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section shall immediately terminate upon the rejection, denial, or revocation of the H-1B petition filed on such F-1 student's behalf.
(C) In order to obtain the automatic extension of stay and employment authorization under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, the F-1 student, according to 8 CFR part 248, must not have violated the terms or conditions of his or her nonimmigrant status.
(D) An automatic extension of an F-1 student's duration of status under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section also applies to the duration of status of any F-2 dependent aliens.

(6) Full course of study—(i) General. Successful completion of the full course of study must lead to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective. A course of study at an institution not approved for attendance by foreign students as provided in §214.3(a)(3) does not satisfy this requirement. A “full course of study” as required by section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act means:
(A) Postgraduate study or postdoctoral study at a college or university, or undergraduate or postgraduate study at a conservatory or religious seminary, certified by a DSO as a full course of study;
(B) Undergraduate study at a college or university, certified by a school official to consist of at least twelve semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter hour systems, where all undergraduate students who are enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or are considered full-time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the district director in the school approval process), except when the student needs a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term;
(C) Study in a postsecondary language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other non-vocational program at a school which confers upon its graduates recognized associate or other degrees or has established that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning which are either: (1) A school (or school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof; or (2) a school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; and which has been certified by a designated school official to consist of at least twelve clock hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by the district director in the school approval process;
(D) Study in any other language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other nonvocational training program, certified by a designated school official to consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or to consist of at least twenty-two clock hours a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of laboratory work; or
(E) Study in a curriculum at an approved private elementary or middle school or public or private academic high school which is certified by a designated school official to consist of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress toward graduation.
(F) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) and (f)(6)(i)(B) of this section, an alien who has been granted employment authorization pursuant to the terms of a document issued by the Commissioner under paragraphs (f)(9)(i) or (f)(9)(ii) of this section and published in the Federal Register shall be deemed to be engaged in a “full course of study” if he or she remains registered for no less than the number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term specified by the Commissioner in the notice for the validity period of such employment authorization.

(G) For F-1 students enrolled in classes for credit or classroom hours, no more than the equivalent of one class or three credits per session, term, semester, trimester, or quarter may be counted toward the full course of study requirement if the class is taken on-line or through distance education and does not require the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to completion of the class. An on-line or distance education course is a course that is offered principally through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing. If the F-1 student's course of study is in a language study program, no on-line or distance education classes may be considered to count toward a student's full course of study requirement.
(H) On-campus employment pursuant to the terms of a scholarship, fellowship, or assistantship is deemed to be part of the academic program of a student otherwise taking a full course of study.
(ii) Institution of higher learning. For purposes of this paragraph, a college or university is an institution of higher learning which awards recognized associate, bachelor's, master's, doctorate, or professional degrees. Schools which devote themselves exclusively or primarily to vocational, business, or language instruction are not included in the category of colleges or universities. Vocational or business schools which are classifiable as M-1 schools are provided for by regulations under 8 CFR 214.2(m).
(iii) Reduced course load. The designated school official may allow an F-1 student to engage in less than a full course of study as provided in this paragraph (f)(6)(iii). Except as otherwise noted, a reduced course load must consist of at least six semester or quarter hours, or half the clock hours required for a full course of study. A student who drops below a full course of study without the prior approval of the DSO will be considered out of status. On-campus employment pursuant to the terms of a scholarship, fellowship, or assistantship is deemed to be part of the academic program of a student otherwise taking a full course of study.
(A) Academic difficulties. The DSO may authorize a reduced course load on account of a student's initial difficulty with the English language or reading requirements, unfamiliarity with U.S. teaching methods, or improper course level placement. The student must resume a full course of study at the next available term, session, or semester, excluding a summer session, in order to maintain student status. A student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to academic difficulties is not eligible for a second authorization by the DSO due to academic difficulties while pursuing a course of study at that program level. A student authorized to drop below a full course of study for academic difficulties while pursuing a course of study at a particular program level may still be authorized for a reduced course load due to an illness medical condition as provided for in paragraph (B) of this section.
(B) Medical conditions. The DSO may authorize a reduced course load (or, if necessary, no course load) due to a student's temporary illness or medical condition for a period of time not to exceed an aggregate of 12 months while the student is pursuing a course of study at a particular program level. In order to authorize a reduced course load based upon a medical condition, the student must provide medical documentation from a licensed medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or licensed clinical psychologist, to the DSO to substantiate the illness or medical condition. The student must provide current medical documentation and the DSO must reauthorize the drop below full course of study each new term, session, or semester. A student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to illness or medical condition for an aggregate of 12 months may not be authorized by a DSO to reduce his or her course load on subsequent occasions while pursuing a course of study at the same program level. A student may be authorized to reduce course load for a reason of illness or medical condition on more than one occasion while pursuing a course of study, so long as the aggregate period of that authorization does not exceed 12 months.
(C) Completion of course of study. The DSO may authorize a reduced course load in the student's final term, semester, or session if fewer courses are needed to complete the course of study. If the student is not required to take any additional courses to satisfy the requirements for completion, but continues to be enrolled for administrative purposes, the student is considered to have completed the course of study and must take action to maintain status. Such action may include application for change of status or departure from the U.S.
(D) Reporting requirements for non-SEVIS schools. A DSO must report to the Service any student who is authorized to reduce his or her course load. Within 21 days of the authorization, the DSO must send a photocopy of the student's current Form I-20ID along with Form I-538 to Service's data processing center indicating the date and reason that the student was authorized to drop below full time status. Similarly, the DSO will report to the Service no more than 21 days after the student has resumed a full course of study by submitting a current copy of the students' Form I-20ID to the Service's data processing center indicating the date a full course of study was resumed and the new program end date with Form I-538, if applicable.
(E) SEVIS reporting requirements. In order for a student to be authorized to drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS prior to the student reducing his or her course load. The DSO must update SEVIS with the date, reason for authorization, and the start date of the next term or session. The DSO must also notify SEVIS within 21 days of the student's commencement of a full course of study. If an extension of the program end date is required due to the drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS by completing a new SEVIS Form I-20 with the new program end date in accordance with paragraph (f)(7) of this section.

(iv) Concurrent enrollment. An F-1 student may be enrolled in two different Service-approved schools at one time as long as the combined enrollment amounts to a full time course of study. In cases where a student is concurrently enrolled, the school from which the student will earn his or her degree or certification should issue the Form I-20, and conduct subsequent certifications and updates to the Form I-20. The DSO from this school is also responsible for all of the reporting requirements to the Service. In instances where a student is enrolled in programs with different full course of study requirements (e.g., clock hours vs. credit hours), the DSO is permitted to determine what constitutes a full time course of study.
(7) Extension of stay—(i) General. An F-1 student who is admitted for duration of status is not required to apply for extension of stay as long as the student is maintaining status and making normal progress toward completion of his or her educational objective. An F-1 student who is currently maintaining status and making normal progress toward completing his or her educational objective, but who is unable to complete his or her course of study by the program end date on the Form I-20, must apply prior to the program end date for a program extension pursuant to paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section.
(ii) Report date and program completion date on Form I-20. When determining the report date on the Form I-20, the DSO may choose a reasonable date to accommodate a student's need to be in attendance for required activities at the school prior to the actual start of classes. Such required activities may include, but are not limited to, research projects and orientation sessions. However, for purposes of employment, the DSO may not indicate a report date more than 30 days prior to the start of classes. When determining the program completion date on Form I-20, the DSO should make a reasonable estimate based upon the time an average student would need to complete a similar program in the same discipline.
(iii) Program extension for students in lawful status. An F-1 student who is unable to meet the program completion date on the Form I-20 may be granted an extension by the DSO if the DSO certifies that the student has continually maintained status and that the delays are caused by compelling academic or medical reasons, such as changes of major or research topics, unexpected research problems, or documented illnesses. Delays caused by academic probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program extensions. A DSO may not grant an extension if the student did not apply for an extension until after the program end date noted on the Form I-20. An F-1 student who is unable to complete the educational program within the time listed on Form I-20 and who is ineligible for program extension pursuant to this paragraph (f)(7) is considered out of status. If eligible, the student may apply for reinstatement under the provisions of paragraph (f)(16) of this section.
(iv) Notification. Upon granting a program extension, a DSO at a non-SEVIS school must immediately submit notification to the Service's data processing center using Form I-538 and the top page of Form I-20A-B showing the new program completion date. For a school enrolled in SEVIS, a DSO may grant a program extension only by updating SEVIS and issuing a new Form I-20 reflecting the current program end date. A DSO may grant an extension any time prior to the program end date listed on the student's original Form I-20.

(8) School transfer. (i) A student who is maintaining status may transfer to another Service approved school by following the notification procedure prescribed in paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section. However, an F-1 student is not permitted to remain in the United States when transferring between schools or programs unless the student will begin classes at the transfer school or program within 5 months of transferring out of the current school or within 5 months of the program completion date on his or her current Form I-20, whichever is earlier. In the case of an F-1 student authorized to engage in post-completion optional practical training (OPT), the student must be able resume classes within 5 months of transferring out of the school that recommended OPT or the date the OPT authorization ends, whichever is earlier. An F-1 student who was not pursuing a full course of study at the school he or she was last authorized to attend is ineligible for school transfer and must apply for reinstatement under the provisions of paragraph (f)(16) of this section, or, in the alternative, may depart the country and return as an initial entry in a new F-1 nonimmigrant status.
(ii) Transfer procedure. To transfer schools, an F-1 student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a Form I-20 A-B, issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k), from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. The transfer will be effected only if the F-1 student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 A-B and returns the form to a designated school official on campus within 15 days of beginning attendance at the new school.
(A) Non-SEVIS School to Non-SEVIS school. To transfer from one non-SEVIS school to a different non-SEVIS school, the student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a Form I-20 issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k) from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Prior to issuance of any Form I-20, the DSO at the transfer school is responsible for determining that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school and is eligible for transfer to the new school. The transfer will be effected only if the student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 and returns the form to a DSO of the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on Form I-20. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 the DSO must note “transfer completed on (date)” in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance at the transfer school; return the Form I-20 to the student; submit the School copy of the Form I-20 to Service's Data Processing Center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and forward a photocopy of the school copy to the school from which the student transferred.
(B) Non-SEVIS school to SEVIS school. To transfer from a non-SEVIS school to a SEVIS school, the student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k) from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Prior to issuance of any Form I-20, the DSO at the transfer school is responsible for determining that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school and is eligible for transfer to the new school. Once the transfer school has issued the SEVIS Form I-20 to the student indicating a transfer, the transfer school becomes responsible for updating and maintaining the student's record in SEVIS. The student is then required to notify the DSO at the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on SEVIS Form I-20. Upon notification that the student is enrolled in classes, the DSO of the transfer school must update SEVIS to reflect the student's registration and current address, thereby acknowledging that the student has completed the transfer process. In the remarks section of the student's SEVIS Form I-20, the DSO must note that the transfer has been completed, including the date, and return the form to the student. The transfer is effected when the transfer school updates SEVIS indicating that the student has registered in classes within the 30 days required by §214.3(g)(3)(iii).
(C) SEVIS school to SEVIS school. To transfer from a SEVIS school to a SEVIS school the student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and must indicate the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school will update the student's record in SEVIS as a “transfer out” and indicate the school to which the student intends to transfer, and a release date. The release date will be the current semester or session completion date, or the date of expected transfer if earlier than the established academic cycle. The current school will retain control over the student's record in SEVIS until the student completes the current term or reaches the release date. At the request of the student, the DSO of the current school may cancel the transfer request at any time prior to the release date. As of the release date specified by the current DSO, the transfer school will be granted full access to the student's SEVIS record and then becomes responsible for that student. The current school conveys authority and responsibility over that student to the transfer school, and will no longer have full SEVIS access to that student's record. As such, a transfer request may not be cancelled by the current DSO after the release date has been reached. After the release date, the transfer DSO must complete the transfer of the student's record in SEVIS and may issue a SEVIS Form I-20. The student is then required to contact the DSO at the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on the SEVIS Form I-20. Upon notification that the student is enrolled in classes, the DSO of the transfer school must update SEVIS to reflect the student's registration and current address, thereby acknowledging that the student has completed the transfer process. In the remarks section of the student's SEVIS Form I-20, the DSO must note that the transfer has been completed, including the date, and return the form to the student. The transfer is effected when the transfer school notifies SEVIS that the student has enrolled in classes in accordance with the 30 days required by §214.3(g)(3)(iii).
(D) SEVIS school to non-SEVIS school. To transfer from a SEVIS school to a non-SEVIS school, the student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and must indicate the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school will update the student's status in SEVIS as “a transfer out”, enter a “release” or expected transfer date, and update the transfer school as “non-SEVIS.” The student must then notify the school to which the he or she intends to transfer of his or her intent to enroll. After the student has completed his or her current term or session, or has reached the expected transfer date, the DSO at the current school will no longer have full access to the student's SEVIS record. At this point, if the student has notified the transfer school of his or her intent to transfer, and the transfer school has determined that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school, the transfer school may issue the student a Form I-20. The transfer will be effected only if the student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 and returns the form to a designated school official of the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on Form I-20. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 the DSO must do as follows: note “transfer completed on (date)” in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance; return the Form I-20 to the student; submit the school copy of the Form I-20 to the Service's data processing center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and forward a photocopy of the school copy to the school from which the student transferred.
(iii) Notification. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 A-B, the DSO must:
(A) Note “transfer completed on (date)” on the student's I-20 ID in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance;
(B) Return the I-20 ID to the student;
(C) Submit the I-20 School copy to the Service's Data Processing Center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and
(D) Forward a photocopy of the Form I-20 A-B School Copy to the school from which the student transferred.
(9) Employment—(i) On-campus employment. On-campus employment must either be performed on the school's premises, (including on-location commercial firms which provide services for students on campus, such as the school bookstore or cafeteria), or at an off-campus location which is educationally affiliated with the school. Employment with on-site commercial firms, such as a construction company building a school building, which do not provide direct student services is not deemed on-campus employment for the purposes of this paragraph. In the case of off-campus locations, the educational affiliation must be associated with the school's established curriculum or related to contractually funded research projects at the post-graduate level. In any event, the employment must be an integral part of the student's educational program. Employment authorized under this paragraph must not exceed 20 hours a week while school is in session, unless the Commissioner suspends the applicability of this limitation due to emergent circumstances, as determined by the Commissioner, by means of notice in the Federal Register, the student demonstrates to the DSO that the employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship resulting from the emergent circumstances, and the DSO notates the Form I-20 in accordance with the Federal Register document. An F-1 student may, however, work on campus full-time when school is not in session or during the annual vacation. A student who has been issued a Form I-20 A-B to begin a new program in accordance with the provision of 8 CFR 214.3(k) and who intends to enroll for the next regular academic year, term, or session at the institution which issued the Form I-20 A-B may continue on-campus employment incident to status. Otherwise, an F-1 student may not engage in on-campus employment after completing a course of study, except employment for practical training as authorized under paragraph (f)(10) of this section. An F-I student may engage in any on-campus employment authorized under this paragraph which will not displace United States residents. In the case of a transfer in SEVIS, the student may only engage in on-campus employment at the school having jurisdiction over the student's SEVIS record. Upon initial entry to begin a new course of study, an F-1 student may not begin on-campus employment more than 30 days prior to the actual start of classes.
(ii) Off-campus work authorization—(A) General. An F-1 student may be authorized to work off-campus on a part-time basis in accordance with paragraph (f)(9)(ii) (B) or (C) of this section after having been in F-1 status for one full academic year provided that the student is in good academic standing as determined by the DSO. Part-time off-campus employment authorized under this section is limited to no more than twenty hours a week when school is in session. A student who is granted off-campus employment authorization may work full-time during holidays or school vacation. The employment authorization is automatically terminated whenever the student fails to maintain status. In emergent circumstances as determined by the Commissioner, the Commissioner may suspend the applicability of any or all of the requirements of paragraph (f)(9)(ii) of this section by notice in the Federal Register.
(B) [Reserved]
(C) Severe economic hardship. If other employment opportunities are not available or are otherwise insufficient, an eligible F-1 student may request off-campus employment work authorization based upon severe economic hardship caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the student's control. These circumstances may include loss of financial aid or on-campus employment without fault on the part of the student, substantial fluctuations in the value of currency or exchange rate, inordinate increases in tuition and/or living costs, unexpected changes in the financial condition of the student's source of support, medical bills, or other substantial and unexpected expenses.
(D) Procedure for off-campus employment authorization due to severe economic hardship. The student must request a recommendation from the DSO for off-campus employment. The DSO at a non-SEVIS school must make such a certification on Form I-538, Certification by Designated School Official. The DSO of a SEVIS school must complete such certification in SEVIS. The DSO may recommend the student for work off-campus for one year intervals by certifying that:
(1) The student has been in F-1 status for one full academic year;
(2) The student is in good standing as a student and is carrying a full course of study as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section;
(3) The student has demonstrated that acceptance of employment will not interfere with the student's carrying a full course of study; and
(4) The student has demonstrated that the employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the student's control pursuant to paragraph (f)(9)(ii)(C) of this section and has demonstrated that employment under paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section is unavailable or otherwise insufficient to meet the needs that have arisen as a result of the unforeseen circumstances.
(E) [Reserved]
(F) Severe economic hardship application. (1) The applicant should submit the economic hardship application for employment authorization on Form I-765, with the fee required by 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), to the service center having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. Applicants at a non-SEVIS school should submit Form I-20, Form I-538, and any other supporting materials such as affidavits which further detail the unforeseen circumstances that require the student to seek employment authorization and the unavailability or insufficiency of employment under paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section. Students enrolled in a SEVIS school should submit the SEVIS Form I-20 with the employment page demonstrating the DSO's comments and certification.
(2) The Service shall adjudicate the application for work authorization based upon severe economic hardship on the basis of Form I-20 ID, Form I-538, and Form I-765, and any additional supporting materials. If employment is authorized, the adjudicating officer shall issue an EAD. The Service director shall notify the student of the decision, and, if the application is denied, of the reason or reasons for the denial. No appeal shall lie from a decision to deny a request for employment authorization under this section. The employment authorization may be granted in one year intervals up to the expected date of completion of the student's current course of study. A student has permission to engage in off-campus employment only if the student receives the EAD endorsed to that effect. Off-campus employment authorization may be renewed by the Service only if the student is maintaining status and good academic standing. The employment authorization is automatically terminated whenever the student fails to maintain status.
(iii) Internship with an international organization. A bona fide F-1 student who has been offered employment by a recognized international organization within the meaning of the International Organization Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669) must apply for employment authorization to the service center having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. A student seeking employment authorization under this provision is required to present a written certification from the international organization that the proposed employment is within the scope of the organization's sponsorship, Form I-20 ID or SEVIS Form I-20 with employment page completed by DSO certifying eligibility for employment, and a completed Form I-765, with required fee as contained in §103.7(b)(1) of this chapter.
(10) Practical training. Practical training may be authorized to an F-1 student who has been lawfully enrolled on a full time basis, in a Service-approved college, university, conservatory, or seminary for one full academic year. This provision also includes students who, during their course of study, were enrolled in a study abroad program, if the student had spent at least one full academic term enrolled in a full course of study in the United States prior to studying abroad. A student may be authorized 12 months of practical training, and becomes eligible for another 12 months of practical training when he or she changes to a higher educational level. Students in English language training programs are ineligible for practical training. An eligible student may request employment authorization for practical training in a position that is directly related to his or her major area of study. There are two types of practical training available:
(i) Curricular practical training. An F-1 student may be authorized by the DSO to participate in a curricular practical training program that is an integral part of an established curriculum. Curricular practical training is defined to be alternative work/study, internship, cooperative education, or any other type of required internship or practicum that is offered by sponsoring employers through cooperative agreements with the school. Students who have received one year or more of full time curricular practical training are ineligible for post-completion academic training. Exceptions to the one academic year requirement are provided for students enrolled in graduate studies that require immediate participation in curricular practical training. A request for authorization for curricular practical training must be made to the DSO. A student may begin curricular practical training only after receiving his or her Form I-20 with the DSO endorsement.
(A) Non-SEVIS process. A student must request authorization for curricular practical training using Form I-538. Upon approving the request for authorization, the DSO shall: certify Form I-538 and send the form to the Service's data processing center; endorse the student's Form I-20 ID with “full-time (or part-time) curricular practical training authorized for (employer) at (location) from (date) to (date)”; and sign and date the Form I-20ID before returning it to the student.
(B) SEVIS process. To grant authorization for a student to engage in curricular practical training, a DSO at a SEVIS school will update the student's record in SEVIS as being authorized for curricular practical training that is directly related to the student's major area of study. The DSO will indicate whether the training is full-time or part-time, the employer and location, and the employment start and end date. The DSO will then print a copy of the employment page of the SEVIS Form I-20 indicating that curricular practical training has been approved. The DSO must sign, date, and return the SEVIS Form I-20 to the student prior to the student's commencement of employment.
(ii) Optional practical training.

(A) General. Consistent with the application and approval process in paragraph (f)(11) of this section, a student may apply to USCIS for authorization for temporary employment for optional practical training directly related to the student's major area of study. The student may not begin optional practical training until the date indicated on his or her employment authorization document, Form I-766. A student may be granted authorization to engage in temporary employment for optional practical training:
(1) During the student's annual vacation and at other times when school is not in session, if the student is currently enrolled, and is eligible for registration and intends to register for the next term or session;
(2) While school is in session, provided that practical training does not exceed 20 hours a week while school is in session; or
(3) After completion of the course of study, or, for a student in a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree program, after completion of all course requirements for the degree (excluding thesis or equivalent). Continued enrollment, for the school's administrative purposes, after all requirements for the degree have been met does not preclude eligibility for optional practical training. A student must complete all practical training within a 14-month period following the completion of study, except that a 24-month extension pursuant to paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section does not need to be completed within such 14-month period.
(B) Termination of practical training. Authorization to engage in optional practical training employment is automatically terminated when the student transfers to another school or begins study at another educational level.
(C) 24-month extension of post-completion OPT for a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) degree. Consistent with paragraph (f)(11)(i)(C) of this section, a qualified student may apply for an extension of OPT while in a valid period of post-completion OPT authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). An extension will be for 24 months for the first qualifying degree for which the student has completed all course requirements (excluding thesis or equivalent), including any qualifying degree as part of a dual degree program, subject to the requirement in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(3) of this section that previously obtained degrees must have been conferred. If a student completes all such course requirements for another qualifying degree at a higher degree level than the first, the student may apply for a second 24-month extension of OPT while in a valid period of post-completion OPT authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). In no event may a student be authorized for more than two lifetime STEM OPT extensions. A student who was granted a 17-month OPT extension under the rule issued at 73 FR 18944, whether or not such student requests an additional 7-month period of STEM OPT under 8 CFR 214.16, is considered to have been authorized for one STEM OPT extension, and may be eligible for only one more STEM OPT extension. Any subsequent application for an additional 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) must be based on a degree at a higher degree level than the degree that was the basis for the student's first OPT extension. In order to qualify for an extension of post-completion OPT based upon a STEM degree, all of the following requirements must be met.
(1) Accreditation. The degree that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension is from a U.S. educational institution accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education at the time of application.
(2) DHS-approved degree. The degree that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension is a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in a field determined by the Secretary, or his or her designee, to qualify within a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics field.
(i) The term “science, technology, engineering or mathematics field” means a field included in the Department of Education's Classification of Instructional Programs taxonomy within the two-digit series or successor series containing engineering, biological sciences, mathematics, and physical sciences, or a related field. In general, related fields will include fields involving research, innovation, or development of new technologies using engineering, mathematics, computer science, or natural sciences (including physical, biological, and agricultural sciences).
(ii) The Secretary, or his or her designee, will maintain the STEM Designated Degree Program List, which will be a complete list of qualifying degree program categories, published on the Student and Exchange Visitor Program Web site at http://www.ice.gov/sevis. Changes that are made to the Designated Degree Program List may also be published in a notice in the Federal Register. All program categories included on the list must be consistent with the definition set forth in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2)(i) of this section.
(iii) At the time the DSO recommends a 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) in SEVIS, the degree that is the basis for the application for the OPT extension must be contained within a category on the STEM Designated Degree Program List.
(3) Previously obtained STEM degree(s). The degree that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) may be, but is not required to be, the degree that is the basis for the post-completion OPT period authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). If an application for a 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) is based upon a degree obtained previous to the degree that provided the basis for the period of post-completion OPT authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B), that previously obtained degree must have been conferred from a U.S. educational institution that is accredited and SEVP-certified at the time the student's DSO recommends the student for the 24-month OPT extension and must be in a degree program category included on the current STEM Designated Degree Program List at the time of the DSO recommendation. That previously obtained degree must have been conferred within the 10 years preceding the date the DSO recommends the student for the 24-month OPT extension.
(4) Eligible practical training opportunity. The STEM practical training opportunity that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) must be directly related to the degree that qualifies the student for such extension, which may be the previously obtained degree described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(3) of this section.
(5) Employer qualification. The student's employer is enrolled in E-Verify, as evidenced by either a valid E-Verify Company Identification number or, if the employer is using an employer agent to create its E-Verify cases, a valid E-Verify Client Company Identification number, and the employer remains a participant in good standing with E-Verify, as determined by USCIS. An employer must also have an employer identification number (EIN) used for tax purposes.
(6) Employer reporting. A student may not be authorized for employment with an employer pursuant to paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section unless the employer agrees, by signing the Training Plan for STEM OPT Students, Form I-983 or successor form, to report the termination or departure of an OPT student to the DSO at the student's school, if the termination or departure is prior to the end of the authorized period of OPT. Such reporting must be made within five business days of the termination or departure. An employer shall consider a student to have departed when the employer knows the student has left the practical training opportunity, or if the student has not reported for his or her practical training for a period of five consecutive business days without the consent of the employer, whichever occurs earlier.
(7) Training Plan for STEM OPT Students, Form I-983 or successor form. (i) A student must fully complete an individualized Form I-983 or successor form and obtain requisite signatures from an appropriate individual in the employer's organization on the form, consistent with form instructions, before the DSO may recommend a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section in SEVIS. A student must submit the Form I-983 or successor form, which includes a certification of adherence to the training plan completed by an appropriate individual in the employer's organization who has signatory authority for the employer, to the student's DSO, prior to the new DSO recommendation. A student must present his or her signed and completed Form I-983 or successor form to a DSO at the educational institution of his or her most recent enrollment. A student, while in F-1 student status, may also be required to submit the Form I-983 or successor form to ICE and/or USCIS upon request or in accordance with form instructions.
(ii) The training plan described in the Form I-983 or successor form must identify goals for the STEM practical training opportunity, including specific knowledge, skills, or techniques that will be imparted to the student, and explain how those goals will be achieved through the work-based learning opportunity with the employer; describe a performance evaluation process; and describe methods of oversight and supervision. Employers may rely on their otherwise existing training programs or policies to satisfy the requirements relating to performance evaluation and oversight and supervision, as applicable.
(iii) The training plan described in the Form I-983 or successor form must explain how the training is directly related to the student's qualifying STEM degree.
(iv) If a student initiates a new practical training opportunity with a new employer during his or her 24-month OPT extension, the student must submit, within 10 days of beginning the new practical training opportunity, a new Form I-983 or successor form to the student's DSO, and subsequently obtain a new DSO recommendation.
(8) Duties, hours, and compensation for training. The terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity during the period of the 24-month OPT extension, including duties, hours, and compensation, must be commensurate with terms and conditions applicable to the employer's similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment. A student may not engage in practical training for less than 20 hours per week, excluding time off taken consistent with leave-related policies applicable to the employer's similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment. If the employer does not employ and has not recently employed more than two similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment, the employer nevertheless remains obligated to attest that the terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity are commensurate with the terms and conditions of employment for other similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment. “Similarly situated U.S. workers” includes U.S. workers performing similar duties subject to similar supervision and with similar educational backgrounds, industry expertise, employment experience, levels of responsibility, and skill sets as the student. The duties, hours, and compensation of such students are “commensurate” with those offered to U.S. workers employed by the employer in the same area of employment when the employer can show that the duties, hours, and compensation are consistent with the range of such terms and conditions the employer has offered or would offer to similarly situated U.S. employees. The student must disclose his or her compensation, including any adjustments, as agreed to with the employer, on the Form I-983 or successor form.
(9) Evaluation requirements and Training Plan modifications. (i) A student may not be authorized for employment with an employer pursuant to paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section unless the student submits a self-evaluation of the student's progress toward the training goals described in the Form I-983 or successor form. All required evaluations must be completed prior to the conclusion of a STEM practical training opportunity, and the student and an appropriate individual in the employer's organization must sign each evaluation to attest to its accuracy. All STEM practical training opportunities require an initial evaluation within 12 months of the approved starting date on the employment authorization document granted pursuant to the student's 24-month OPT extension application, and a concluding evaluation. The student is responsible for ensuring the DSO receives his or her 12-month evaluation and final evaluation no later than 10 days following the conclusion of the reporting period or conclusion of his or her practical training opportunity, respectively.
(ii) If any material change to or deviation from the training plan described in the Form I-983 or successor form occurs, the student and employer must sign a modified Form I-983 or successor form reflecting the material change(s) or deviation(s). Material changes and deviations relating to training may include, but are not limited to, any change of Employer Identification Number resulting from a corporate restructuring, any reduction in compensation from the amount previously submitted on the Form I-983 or successor form that is not tied to a reduction in hours worked, any significant decrease in hours per week that a student engages in a STEM training opportunity, and any decrease in hours worked below the minimum hours for the 24-month extension as described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(8) of this section. Material changes and deviations also include any change or deviation that renders an employer attestation inaccurate, or renders inaccurate the information in the Form I-983 or successor form on the nature, purpose, oversight, or assessment of the student's practical training opportunity. The student and employer must ensure that the modified Form I-983 or successor form is submitted to the student's DSO at the earliest available opportunity.
(iii) The educational institution whose DSO is responsible for duties associated with the student's latest OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section is responsible for ensuring the Student and Exchange Visitor Program has access to each individualized Form I-983 or successor form and associated student evaluations (electronic or hard copy), including through SEVIS if technologically available, beginning within 30 days after the document is submitted to the DSO and continuing for a period of three years following the completion of each STEM practical training opportunity.
(10) Additional STEM opportunity obligations. A student may only participate in a STEM practical training opportunity in which the employer attests, including by signing the Form I-983 or successor form, that:
(i) The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available and is prepared to provide appropriate training in connection with the specified opportunity at the location(s) specified in the Form I-983 or successor form;
(ii) The student on a STEM OPT extension will not replace a full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. worker; and
(iii) The student's opportunity assists the student in reaching his or her training goals.
(11) Site visits. DHS, at its discretion, may conduct a site visit of any employer. The purpose of the site visit is for DHS to ensure that each employer possesses and maintains the ability and resources to provide structured and guided work-based learning experiences consistent with any Form I-983 or successor form completed and signed by the employer. DHS will provide notice to the employer 48 hours in advance of any site visit, except notice may not be provided if the visit is triggered by a complaint or other evidence of noncompliance with the regulations in this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C).
(D) Duration of status while on post-completion OPT. For a student with approved post-completion OPT, the duration of status is defined as the period beginning on the date that the student's application for OPT was properly filed and pending approval, including the authorized period of post-completion OPT, and ending 60 days after the OPT employment authorization expires.
(E) Periods of unemployment during post-completion OPT. During post-completion OPT, F-1 status is dependent upon employment. Students may not accrue an aggregate of more than 90 days of unemployment during any post-completion OPT period described in 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). Students granted a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section may not accrue an aggregate of more than 150 days of unemployment during a total OPT period, including any post-completion OPT period described in 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B) and any subsequent 24-month extension period.
(11) OPT application and approval process—(i) Student responsibilities. A student must initiate the OPT application process by requesting a recommendation for OPT from his or her DSO. Upon making the recommendation, the DSO will provide the student a signed Form I-20 indicating that recommendation.
(A) Applications for employment authorization. The student must properly file an Application for Employment Authorization, Form I-765 or successor form, with USCIS, accompanied by the required fee, and the supporting documents, as described in the form's instructions.
(B) Applications and filing deadlines for pre-completion OPT and post-completion OPT—(1) Pre-completion OPT. For pre-completion OPT, the student may properly file his or her Form I-765 or successor form up to 90 days before being enrolled for one full academic year, provided that the period of employment will not start prior to the completion of the full academic year.
(2) Post-completion OPT. For post-completion OPT, not including a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section, the student may properly file his or her Form I-765 or successor form up to 90 days prior to his or her program end date and no later than 60 days after his or her program end date. The student must also file his or her Form I-765 or successor form with USCIS within 30 days of the date the DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into his or her SEVIS record.
(C) Applications and filing deadlines for 24-month OPT extension. A student meeting the eligibility requirements for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section may request an extension of employment authorization by filing Form I-765 or successor form, with the required fee and supporting documents, up to 90 days prior to the expiration date of the student's current OPT employment authorization. The student seeking such 24-month OPT extension must properly file his or her Form I-765 or successor form with USCIS within 60 days of the date the DSO enters the recommendation for the OPT extension into his or her SEVIS record. If a student timely and properly files an application for such 24-month OPT extension and timely and properly requests a DSO recommendation, including by submitting the fully executed Form I-983 or successor form to his or her DSO, but the Employment Authorization Document, Form I-766 or successor form, currently in the student's possession expires prior to the decision on the student's application for the OPT extension, the student's Form I-766 or successor form is extended automatically pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(6)(iv).
(D) Start of OPT employment. A student may not begin OPT employment prior to the approved start date on his or her Employment Authorization Document, Form I-766 or successor form, except as described in paragraph (f)(11)(i)(C) of this section. A student may not request a start date that is more than 60 days after the student's program end date. Employment authorization will begin on the date requested or the date the employment authorization is adjudicated, whichever is later.
(ii) Additional DSO responsibilities. A student must have a recommendation from his or her DSO in order to apply for OPT. When a DSO recommends a student for OPT, the school assumes the added responsibility for maintaining the SEVIS record of that student for the entire period of authorized OPT, consistent with paragraph (f)(12) of this section.
(A) Prior to making a recommendation, the DSO at the educational institution of the student's most recent enrollment must ensure that the student is eligible for the given type and period of OPT and that the student is aware of the student's responsibilities for maintaining status while on OPT. Prior to recommending a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section, the DSO at the educational institution of the student's most recent enrollment must certify that the student's degree being used to qualify that student for the 24-month OPT extension, as shown in SEVIS or official transcripts, is a bachelor's, master's, or doctorate degree with a degree code that is contained within a category on the current STEM Designated Degree Program List at the time the recommendation is made. A DSO may recommend a student for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section only if the Form I-983 or successor form described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(7) of this section has been properly completed and executed by the student and prospective employer. A DSO may not recommend a student for an OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section if the practical training would be conducted by an employer who has failed to meet the requirements under paragraphs (f)(10)(ii)(C)(5) through (9) of this section or has failed to provide the required assurances of paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(10) of this section.
(B) The DSO must update the student's SEVIS record with the DSO's recommendation for OPT before the student can apply to USCIS for employment authorization. The DSO will indicate in SEVIS whether the OPT employment is to be full-time or part-time, or for a student seeking a recommendation for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section whether the OPT employment meets the minimum hours requirements described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(8) of this section, and note in SEVIS the OPT start and end dates.
(C) The DSO must provide the student with a signed, dated Form I-20 or successor form indicating that OPT has been recommended.
(iii) Decision on application for OPT employment authorization. USCIS will adjudicate a student's Form I-765 or successor form on the basis of the DSO's recommendation and other eligibility considerations.
(A) If granted, the employment authorization period for post-completion OPT begins on the requested date of commencement or the date the Form I-765 or successor form is approved, whichever is later, and ends at the conclusion of the remaining time period of post-completion OPT eligibility. The employment authorization period for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section begins on the day after the expiration of the initial post-completion OPT employment authorization and ends 24 months thereafter, regardless of the date the actual extension is approved.
(B) USCIS will notify the applicant of the decision on the Form I-765 or successor form in writing, and, if the application is denied, of the reason or reasons for the denial.
(C) The applicant may not appeal the decision.
(12) Reporting while on optional practical training—(i) General. An F-1 student who is granted employment authorization by USCIS to engage in optional practical training is required to report any change of name or address, or interruption of such employment to the DSO for the duration of the optional practical training. A DSO who recommends a student for OPT is responsible for updating the student's record to reflect these reported changes for the duration of the time that training is authorized.
(ii) Additional reporting obligations for students with an approved 24-month OPT extension. Students with an approved 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section have additional reporting obligations. Compliance with these reporting requirements is required to maintain F-1 status. The reporting obligations are:
(A) Within 10 days of the change, the student must report to the student's DSO a change of legal name, residential or mailing address, employer name, employer address, and/or loss of employment.
(B) The student must complete a validation report, confirming that the information required by paragraph (f)(12)(ii)(A) of this section has not changed, every six months. The requirement for validation reporting starts on the date the 24-month OPT extension begins and ends when the student's F-1 status expires or the 24-month OPT extension concludes, whichever is first. The validation report is due to the student's DSO within 10 business days of each reporting date.
(13) Temporary absence from the United States of F-1 student granted employment authorization. (i) A student returning from a temporary trip abroad with an unexpired off-campus employment authorization on his or her I-20 ID may resume employment only if the student is readmitted to attend the same school which granted the employment authorization.
(ii) An F-1 student who has an unexpired EAD issued for post-completion practical training and who is otherwise admissible may return to the United States to resume employment after a period of temporary absence. The EAD must be used in combination with an I-20 ID endorsed for reentry by the DSO within the last six months.
(14) Effect of strike or other labor dispute. Any employment authorization, whether or not part of an academic program, is automatically suspended upon certification by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's designee to the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service or the Commissioner's designee, that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place of employment. As used in this paragraph, “place of employment” means the facility or facilities where a labor dispute exists. The employer is prohibited from transferring F-1 students working at other facilities to the facility where the work stoppage is occurring.
(15) Spouse and children of F-1 student. The F-2 spouse and minor children of an F-1 student shall each be issued an individual SEVIS Form I-20 in accordance with the provisions of §214.3(k).
(i) Employment. The F-2 spouse and children of an F-1 student may not accept employment.
(ii) Study—(A) F-2 post-secondary/vocational study—(1) Authorized study at SEVP-certified schools. An F-2 spouse or F-2 child may enroll in less than a full course of study, as defined in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) and (m)(9)(i) through (iv), in any course of study described in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) or (m)(9)(i) through (iv) of this section at an SEVP-certified school. Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(B) and (m)(9)(i) of this section, study at an undergraduate college or university or at a community college or junior college is not a full course of study solely because the F-2 nonimmigrant is engaging in a lesser course load to complete a course of study during the current term. An F-2 spouse or F-2 child enrolled in less than a full course of study is not eligible to engage in employment pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9) and (10) of this section or pursuant to paragraph (m)(14) of this section.
(2) Full course of study. Subject to paragraphs (f)(15)(ii)(B) and (f)(18) of this section, an F-2 spouse and child may engage in a full course of study only by applying for and obtaining a change of status to F-1, M-1 or J-1 nonimmigrant status, as appropriate, before beginning a full course of study. An F-2 spouse and child may engage in study that is avocational or recreational in nature, up to and including on a full-time basis.
(B) F-2 elementary or secondary study. An F-2 child may engage in full-time study, including any full course of study, in any elementary or secondary school (kindergarten through twelfth grade).
(C) An F-2 spouse and child violates his or her nonimmigrant status by enrolling in any study except as provided in paragraph (f)(15)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(16) Reinstatement to student status—(i) General. The district director may consider reinstating a student who makes a request for reinstatement on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, accompanied by a properly completed SEVIS Form I-20 indicating the DSO's recommendation for reinstatement (or a properly completed Form I-20A-B issued prior to January 30, 2003, from the school the student is attending or intends to attend prior to August 1, 2003). The district director may consider granting the request if the student:
(A) Has not been out of status for more than 5 months at the time of filing the request for reinstatement (or demonstrates that the failure to file within the 5 month period was the result of exceptional circumstances and that the student filed the request for reinstatement as promptly as possible under these exceptional circumstances);
(B) Does not have a record of repeated or willful violations of Service regulations;
(C) Is currently pursuing, or intending to pursue, a full course of study in the immediate future at the school which issued the Form I-20;
(D) Has not engaged in unauthorized employment;
(E) Is not deportable on any ground other than section 237(a)(1)(B) or (C)(i) of the Act; and
(F) Establishes to the satisfaction of the Service, by a detailed showing, either that:
(1) The violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond the student's control. Such circumstances might include serious injury or illness, closure of the institution, a natural disaster, or inadvertence, oversight, or neglect on the part of the DSO, but do not include instances where a pattern of repeated violations or where a willful failure on the part of the student resulted in the need for reinstatement; or
(2) The violation relates to a reduction in the student's course load that would have been within a DSO's power to authorize, and that failure to approve reinstatement would result in extreme hardship to the student.
(ii) Decision. If the Service reinstates the student, the Service shall endorse the student's copy of Form I-20 to indicate the student has been reinstated and return the form to the student. If the Form I-20 is from a non-SEVIS school, the school copy will be forwarded to the school. If the Form I-20 is from a SEVIS school, the adjudicating officer will update SEVIS to reflect the Service's decision. In either case, if the Service does not reinstate the student, the student may not appeal that decision.
(17) Current name and address. A student must inform the DSO and the Service of any legal changes to his or her name or of any change of address, within 10 days of the change, in a manner prescribed by the school. A student enrolled at a SEVIS school can satisfy the requirement in 8 CFR 265.1 of notifying the Service by providing a notice of a change of address within 10 days to the DSO, who in turn shall enter the information in SEVIS within 21 days of notification by the student. A student enrolled at a non-SEVIS school must submit a notice of change of address to the Service, as provided in 8 CFR 265.1, within 10 days of the change. Except in the case of a student who cannot receive mail where he or she resides, the address provided by the student must be the actual physical location where the student resides rather than a mailing address. In cases where a student provides a mailing address, the school must maintain a record of, and must provide upon request from the Service, the actual physical location where the student resides.
(18) Special rules for certain border commuter students—(i) Applicability. For purposes of the special rules in this paragraph (f)(18), the term “border commuter student” means a national of Canada or Mexico who is admitted to the United States as an F-1 nonimmigrant student to enroll in a full course of study, albeit on a part-time basis, in an approved school located within 75 miles of a United States land border. A border commuter student must maintain actual residence and place of abode in the student's country of nationality, and seek admission to the United States at a land border port-of-entry. These special rules do not apply to a national of Canada or Mexico who is:
(A) Residing in the United States while attending an approved school as an F-1 student, or
(B) Enrolled in a full course of study as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section.
(ii) Full course of study. The border commuter student must be enrolled in a full course of study at the school that leads to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective, albeit on a part-time basis. A designated school official at the school may authorize an eligible border commuter student to enroll in a course load below that otherwise required for a full course of study under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, provided that the reduced course load is consistent with the border commuter student's approved course of study.
(iii) Period of admission. An F-1 nonimmigrant student who is admitted as a border commuter student under this paragraph (f)(18) will be admitted until a date certain. The DSO is required to specify a completion date on the Form I-20 that reflects the actual semester or term dates for the commuter student's current term of study. A new Form I-20 will be required for each new semester or term that the border commuter student attends at the school. The provisions of paragraphs (f)(5) and (f)(7) of this section, relating to duration of status and extension of stay, are not applicable to a border commuter student.
(iv) Employment. A border commuter student may not be authorized to accept any employment in connection with his or her F-1 student status, except for curricular practical training as provided in paragraph (f)(10)(i) of this section or post-completion optional practical training as provided in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(A)(3) of this section.
(19) Remittance of the fee. An alien who applies for F-1 or F-3 nonimmigrant status in order to enroll in a program of study at a Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-approved educational institution is required to pay the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee to DHS, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.13, except as otherwise provided in that section.

Each exchange alien participating in a program of graduate medical education or training shall file Form I-644 (Supplementary Statement for Graduate Medical Trainees) annually with the Service attesting to the conditions as specified on the form. The exchange alien shall also submit Form I-644 as an attachment to a completed Form DS-2019 when applying for an extension of stay.
When the approval of an exchange visitor program is withdrawn by the Director of the United States Information Agency, the district director shall send a notice of the withdrawal to each participant in the program and a copy of each such notice shall be sent to the program sponsor. If the exchange visitor is currently engaged in activities authorized by the cancelled program, the participant is authorized to remain in the United States to engage in those activities until expiration of the period of stay previously authorized. The district director shall notify participants in cancelled programs that permission to remain in the United States as an exchange visitor, or extension of stay may be obtained if the participant is accepted in another approved program and a Form DS-2019, executed by the new program sponsor, is submitted. In this case, a release from the sponsor of the cancelled program will not be required.

(m) Students in established vocational or other recognized nonacademic institutions, other than in language training programs—(1) Admission of student—(i) Eligibility for admission. A nonimmigrant student may be admitted into the United States in nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(M) of the Act, if:
(A) The student presents a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in his or her own name by a school approved by the Service for attendance by M-1 foreign students. (In the alternative, for a student seeking admission prior to August 1, 2003, the student may present a currently-valid Form I-20M-N/I-20ID, if that form was issued by the school prior to January 30, 2003);
(B) The student has documentary evidence of financial support in the amount indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20M-N/I-20ID); and
(C) For students seeking initial admission only, the student intends to attend the school specified in the student's visa (or, where the student is exempt from the requirement for a visa, the school indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20M-N/I-20ID)).
(ii) Disposition of Form I-20M-N. When a student is admitted to the United States, the inspecting officer shall forward Form I-20M-N to the Service's processing center. The processing center shall forward Form I-20N to the school which issued the form to notify the school of the student's admission.
(iii) Use of SEVIS. On January 30, 2003, the use of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) will become mandatory for the issuance of any new Form I-20. A student or dependent who presents a non-SEVIS Form I-20 issued on or after January 30, 2003, will not be accepted for admission to the United States. Non-SEVIS Forms I-20 issued prior to January 30, 2003, will continue to be accepted for admission to the United States until August 1, 2003. However, schools must issue a SEVIS Form I-20 to any current student requiring a reportable action (e.g., extension of status, practical training, and requests for employment authorization) or a new Form I-20, or for any aliens who must obtain a new nonimmigrant student visa. As of August 1, 2003, the records of all current or continuing students must be entered in SEVIS.
(2) Form I-20 ID copy. The first time an M-1 student comes into contact with the Service for any reason, the student must present to the Service a Form I-20M-N properly and completely filled out by the student and by the designated official of the school the student is attending or intends to attend. The student will be issued a Form I-20 ID copy with his or her admission number. The student must have the Form I-20 ID copy with him or her at all times. If the student loses the Form I-20 ID copy, the student must request a new Form I-20 ID copy on Form I-102 from the Service office having jurisdiction over the school the student was last authorized to attend.
(3) Admission of the spouse and minor children of an M-1 student. The spouse and minor children accompanying an M-1 student are eligible for admission in M-2 status if the student is admitted in M-1 status. The spouse and minor children following-to-join an M-1 student are eligible for admission to the United States in M-2 status if they are able to demonstrate that the M-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study, or engaged in approved practical training following completion of studies. In either case, at the time they seek admission, the eligible spouse and minor children of an M-1 student with a SEVIS Form I-20 must individually present an original SEVIS Form I-20 issued in the name of each M-2 dependent issued by a school authorized by the Service for attendance by M-1 foreign students. Prior to August 1, 2003, if exigent circumstances are demonstrated, the Service will allow the dependent of an M-1 student in possession of a SEVIS Form I-20 to enter the United States using a copy of the M-1 student's SEVIS Form I-20. (In the alternative, for dependents seeking admission to the United States prior to August 1, 2003, a copy of the M-1 student's current Form I-20ID issued prior to January 30, 2003, with proper endorsement by the DSO will satisfy this requirement.) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or Form I-20M-N) is required for a dependent where there has been any substantive change in the M-1 student's current information.
(i) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued; or
(ii) A new Form I-20M-N if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued.
(4) Temporary absence—(i) General. An M-1 student returning to the United States from a temporary absence to attend the school which the student was previously authorized to attend must present either—
(A) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued; or
(B) A new Form I-20M-N if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued.
(ii) Student who transferred between schools. If an M-1 student has been authorized to transfer between schools and is returning to the United States from a temporary absence in order to attend the school to which transfer was authorized as indicated on the student's Form I-20 ID copy, the name of the school to which the student is destined does not need to be specified in the student's visa.
(5) Period of stay. A student in M nonimmigrant status is admitted for a fixed time period, which is the period necessary to complete the course of study indicated on the Form I-20, plus practical training following completion of the course of study, plus an additional 30 days to depart the United States, but not to exceed a total period of one year. An M-1 student may be admitted for a period up to 30 days before the report date or start date of the course of study listed on the Form I-20. An M-1 student who fails to maintain a full course of study or otherwise fails to maintain status is not eligible for the additional 30-day period of stay.
(6)-(8) [Reserved]
(9) Full course of study. Successful completion of the course of study must lead to the attainment of a specific educational or vocational objective. A “full course of study” as required by section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act means—
(i) Study at a community college or junior college, certified by a school official to consist of at least twelve semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter-hour systems, where all students enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or considered full-time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the district director) except when the student needs a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term;
(ii) Study at a postsecondary vocational or business school, other than in a language training program except as provided in §214.3(a)(2)(iv), which confers upon its graduates recognized associate or other degrees or has established that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning which are either: (1) A school (or school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof; or (2) a school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; and which has been certified by a designated school official to consist of at least twelve hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by the district director;
(iii) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic curriculum, other than in a language training program except as provided in §214.3(a)(2)(iv), certified by a designated school official to consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or at least twenty-two clock hours a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of shop or laboratory work; or
(iv) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic high school curriculum, certified by a designated school official to consist of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress towards graduation.
(v) On-line courses/distance education programs. No on-line or distance education classes may be considered to count toward an M-1 student's full course of study requirement if such classes do not require the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to completion of the class. An on-line or distance education course is a course that is offered principally through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing.
(vi) Reduced course load. The designated school official may authorize an M-1 student to engage in less than a full course of study only where the student has been compelled by illness or a medical condition that has been documented by a licensed medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or licensed clinical psychologist, to interrupt or reduce his or her course of study. A DSO may not authorize a reduced course load for more than an aggregate of 5 months per course of study. An M-1 student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to illness or medical condition for an aggregate of 5 months, may not be authorized by the DSO to reduce his or her course load on subsequent occasions during his or her particular course of study.
(A) Non-SEVIS schools. A DSO must report any student who has been authorized by the DSO to carry a reduced course load. Within 21 days of the authorization, the DSO must send a photocopy of the student's Form I-20 to the Service's data processing center indicating the date that authorization was granted. The DSO must also report to the Service's data processing center when the student has resumed a full course of study, no more than 21 days from the date the student resumed a full course of study. In this case, the DSO must submit a photocopy of the student's Form I-20 indicating the date that a full course of study was resumed, with a new program end date.
(B) SEVIS reporting. In order for a student to be authorized to drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS prior to the student reducing his or her course load. The DSO must update SEVIS with the date, reason for authorization, and the start date of the next term or session. The DSO must also notify SEVIS within 21 days of the student's commencement of a full course of study.

(10) Extension of stay—(i) Eligibility. The cumulative time of extensions that can be granted to an M-1 student is limited to a period of 3 years from the M-1 student's original start date, plus 30 days. No extension can be granted to an M-1 student if the M-1 student is unable to complete the course of study within 3 years of the original program start date. This limit includes extensions that have been granted due to a drop below full course of study, a transfer of schools, or reinstatement. An M-1 student may be granted an extension of stay if it is established that:
(A) He or she is a bona fide nonimmigrant currently maintaining student status;
(B) Compelling educational or medical reasons have resulted in a delay to his or her course of study. Delays caused by academic probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program extension; and
(C) He or she is able to, and in good faith intends to, continue to maintain that status for the period for which the extension is granted.
(ii) Application. A student must apply to the Service for an extension on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status. A student's M-2 spouse and children seeking an extension of stay must be included in the application. The student must submit the application to the service center having jurisdiction over the school the student is currently authorized to attend, at least 15 days but not more than 60 days before the program end date on the student's Form I-20. The application must also be accompanied by the student's Form I-20 and the Forms I-94 of the student's spouse and children, if applicable.
(iii) Period of stay. If an application for extension is granted, the student and the student's spouse and children, if applicable, are to be given an extension of stay for the period of time necessary to complete the course of study, plus 30 days within which to depart from the United States, or for a total period of one year, whichever is less. A student's M-2 spouse and children are not eligible for an extension unless the M-1 student is granted an extension of stay, or for a longer period than is granted to the M-1 student.
(iv) SEVIS update. A DSO must update SEVIS to recommend that a student be approved for an extension of stay. The SEVIS Form I-20 must be printed with the recommendation and new program end date for submission by mail to the service center, with Form I-539, and Forms I-94 if applicable.
(11) School transfer—(i) Eligibility. An M-1 student may not transfer to another school after six months from the date the student is first admitted as, or changes nonimmigrant classification to that of, an M-1 student unless the student is unable to remain at the school to which the student was initially admitted due to circumstances beyond the student's control. An M-1 student may be otherwise eligible to transfer to another school if the student—
(A) Is a bona fide nonimmigrant;
(B) Has been pursuing a full course of study at the school the student was last authorized to attend;
(C) Intends to pursue a full course of study at the school to which the student intends to transfer; and
(D) Is financially able to attend the school to which the student intends to transfer.
(ii) Procedure. A student must apply to the Service on Form I-539 for permission to transfer between schools. Upon application for school transfer, a student may effect the transfer subject to approval of the application. A student who transfers without complying with this requirement or whose application is denied after transfer pursuant to this regulation is considered to be out of status. If the application is approved, the approval of the transfer will be determined to be the program start date listed on the Form I-20, and the student will be granted an extension of stay for the period of time necessary to complete the new course of study plus 30 days, or for a total period of one year, whichever is less.
(A) Non-SEVIS school. The application must be accompanied by the Form I-20ID copy and the Form I-94 of the student's spouse and children, if applicable. The Form I-539 must also be accompanied by Form I-20M-N properly and completely filled out by the student and by the designated official of the school which the student wishes to attend. Upon approval, the adjudicating officer will endorse the name of the school to which the transfer is authorized on the student's Form I-20ID copy and return it to the student. The officer will also endorse Form I-20M-N to indicate that a school transfer has been authorized and forward it to the Service's processing center for updating. The processing center will forward Form I-20M-N to the school to which the transfer has been authorized to notify the school of the action taken.
(B) SEVIS school. The student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and indicate the school to which the student intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school must update SEVIS to show the student as a “transfer out” and input the “release date” for transfer. Once updated as a “transfer out” the transfer school is permitted to generate a SEVIS Form I-20 for transfer but will not gain access to the student's SEVIS record until the release date is reached. Upon receipt of the SEVIS Form I-20 from the transfer school, the student must submit Form I-539 in accordance with §214.2(m)(11). The student may enroll in the transfer school at the next available term or session and is required to notify the DSO of the transfer school immediately upon beginning attendance. The transfer school must update the student's registration record in SEVIS in accordance with §214.3(g)(3). Upon approval of the transfer application, the Service officer will endorse the name of the school to which the transfer is authorized on the student's SEVIS Form I-20 and return it to the student.
(C) Transition process. Once SEVIS is fully operational and interfaced with the service center benefit processing system, the Service officer will transmit the approval of the transfer to SEVIS and endorse the name of the school to which transfer is authorized on the student's SEVIS Form I-20 and return it to the student. As part of a transitional process until that time, the student is required to notify the DSO at the transfer school of the decision of the Service within 15 days of the receipt of the adjudication by the Service. Upon notification by the student of the approval of the Service, the DSO must immediately update SEVIS to show that approval of the transfer has been granted. The DSO must then print an updated SEVIS Form I-20 for the student indicating that the transfer has been completed. If the application for transfer is denied, the student is out of status and the DSO must terminate the student's record in SEVIS.
(iii) Student who has not been pursuing a full course of study. If an M-1 student who has not been pursuing a full course of study at the school the student was last authorized to attend desires to attend a different school, the student must apply for reinstatement to student status under paragraph (m)(16) of this section.
(12) Change in educational objective. An M-1 student may not change educational objective.
(13) Employment. Except as provided in paragraph (m)(14) of this section, a student may not accept employment.
(14) Practical training—(i) When practical training may be authorized. Temporary employment for practical training may be authorized only after completion of the student's course of study.
(A) The proposed employment is recommended for the purpose of practical training;
(B) The proposed employment is related to the student's course of study; and
(C) Upon the designated school official's information and belief, employment comparable to the proposed employment is not available to the student in the country of the student's foreign residence.
(ii) Application. A M-1 student must apply for permission to accept employment for practical training on Form I-765, with fee as contained in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), accompanied by a Form I-20 that has been endorsed for practical training by the designated school official. The application must be submitted prior to the program end date listed on the student's Form I-20 but not more than 90 days before the program end date. The designated school official must certify on Form I-538 that—
(A) The proposed employment is recommended for the purpose of practical training;
(B) The proposed employment is related to the student's course of study; and
(C) Upon the designated school official's information and belief, employment comparable to the proposed employment is not available to the student in the country of the student's foreign residence.
(iii) Duration of practical training. When the student is authorized to engage in employment for practical training, he or she will be issued an employment authorization document. The M-1 student may not begin employment until he or she has been issued an employment authorization document by the Service. One month of employment authorization will be granted for each four months of full-time study that the M-1 student has completed. However, an M-1 student may not engage in more than six months of practical training in the aggregate. The student will not be granted employment authorization if he or she cannot complete the requested practical training within six months.
(iv) Temporary absence of M-1 student granted practical training. An M-1 student who has been granted permission to accept employment for practical training and who temporarily departs from the United States, may be readmitted for the remainder of the authorized period indicated on the student's Form I-20 ID copy. The student must be returning to the United States to perform the authorized practical training. A student may not be readmitted to begin practical training which was not authorized prior to the student's departure from the United States.
(v) Effect of strike or other labor dispute. Authorization for all employment for practical training is automatically suspended upon certification by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's designee to the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization or the Commissioner's designee that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place of employment. As used in this paragraph, “place of employment” means wherever the employer or joint employer does business.
(vi) SEVIS process. The DSO must update the student's record in SEVIS to recommend that the Service approve the student for practical training, and print SEVIS Form I-20 with the recommendation, for the student to submit to the Service with Form I-765 as provided in this paragraph (m)(14).
(15) Decision on application for extension, permission to transfer to another school, or permission to accept employment for practical training. The Service shall notify the applicant of the decision and, if the application is denied, of the reason(s) for the denial. The applicant may not appeal the decision.
(16) Reinstatement to student status—(i) General. A district director may consider reinstating a student who makes a request for reinstatement on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, accompanied by a properly completed SEVIS Form I-20 indicating the DSO's recommendation for reinstatement (or a properly completed Form I-20M-N issued prior to January 30, 2003, from the school the student is attending or intends to attend prior to August 1, 2003). The district director may consider granting the request only if the student:
(A) Has not been out of status for more than 5 months at the time of filing the request for reinstatement (or demonstrates that the failure to file within the 5 month period was the result of exceptional circumstances and that the student filed the request for reinstatement as promptly as possible under these exceptional circumstances);
(B) Does not have a record of repeated or willful violations of the Service regulations;
(C) Is currently pursuing, or intends to pursue, a full course of study at the school which issued the Form I-20M-N or SEVIS Form I-20;
(D) Has not engaged in unlawful employment;
(E) Is not deportable on any ground other than section 237(a)(1)(B) or (C)(i) of the Act; and
(F) Establishes to the satisfaction of the Service, by a detailed showing, either that:
(1) The violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond the student's control. Such circumstances might include serious injury or illness, closure of the institution, a natural disaster, or inadvertence, oversight or neglect on the part of the DSO, but do not include instances where a pattern of repeated violations or where a willful failure on the part of the student resulted in the need for reinstatement; or
(2) The violation relates to a reduction in the student's course load that would have been within a DSO's power to authorize, and that failure to approve reinstatement would result in extreme hardship to the student.
(ii) Decision. If the Service reinstates the student, the Service shall endorse the student's copy of Form I-20 to indicate that the student has been reinstated and return the form to the student. If the Form I-20 is from a non-SEVIS school, the school copy will be forwarded to the school. If the Form I-20 is from a SEVIS school, the adjudicating officer will update SEVIS to reflect the Service's decision. In either case, if the Service does not reinstate the student, the student may not appeal the decision. The district director will send notification to the school of the decision.
(17) Spouse and children of M-1 student. The M-2 spouse and minor children of an M-1 student shall each be issued an individual SEVIS Form I-20 in accordance with the provisions of §214.3(k).
(i) Employment. The M-2 spouse and children may not accept employment.
(ii) Study—(A) M-2 post-secondary/vocational study—(1) Authorized study at SEVP-certified schools. An M-2 spouse or M-2 child may enroll in less than a full course of study, as defined in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) or (m)(9)(i) through (v), in any course of study described in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) or (m)(9)(i) through (v) of this section at an SEVP-certified school. Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(B) and (m)(9)(i) of this section, study at an undergraduate college or university or at a community college or junior college is not a full course of study solely because the M-2 nonimmigrant is engaging in a lesser course load to complete a course of study during the current term. An M-2 spouse or M-2 child enrolled in less than a full course of study is not eligible to engage in employment pursuant to paragraph (m)(14) of this section or pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9) through (10) of this section.
(2) Full course of study. Subject to paragraph (m)(17)(ii)(B) of this section, an M-2 spouse and child may engage in a full course of study only by applying for and obtaining a change of status to F-1, M-1, or J-1 status, as appropriate, before beginning a full course of study. An M-2 spouse and M-2 child may engage in study that is avocational or recreational in nature, up to and including on a full-time basis.
(B) M-2 elementary or secondary study. An M-2 child may engage in full-time study, including any full course of study, in any elementary or secondary school (kindergarten through twelfth grade).
(C) An M-2 spouse or child violates his or her nonimmigrant status by enrolling in any study except as provided in paragraph (m)(17)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(18) Current name and address. A student must inform the Service and the DSO of any legal changes to his or her name or of any change of address, within 10 days of the change, in a manner prescribed by the school. A student enrolled at a SEVIS school can satisfy the requirement in 8 CFR 265.1 of notifying the Service by providing a notice of a change of address within 10 days to the DSO, and the DSO in turn shall enter the information in SEVIS within 21 days of notification by the student. A nonimmigrant student enrolled at a non-SEVIS institution must submit a notice of change of address to the Service, as provided in 8 CFR 265.1, within 10 days of the change. Except in the case of a student who cannot receive mail where he or she resides, the address provided by the student must be the actual physical location where the student resides rather than a mailing address. In cases where a student provides a mailing address, the school must maintain a record of, and must provide upon request from the Service, the actual physical location where the student resides.
(19) Special rules for certain border commuter students—(i) Applicability. For purposes of the special rules in this paragraph (m)(19), the term “border commuter student” means a national of Canada or Mexico who is admitted to the United States as an M-1 student to enroll in a full course of study, albeit on a part-time basis, in an approved school located within 75 miles of a United States land border. The border commuter student must maintain actual residence and place of abode in the student's country of nationality, and seek admission to the United States at a land border port-of-entry. These special rules do not apply to a national of Canada or Mexico who is:
(A) Residing in the United States while attending an approved school as an M-1 student, or
(B) Enrolled in a full course of study as defined in paragraph (m)(9) of this section.
(ii) Full course of study. The border commuter student must be enrolled in a full course of study at the school that leads to the attainment of a specific educational or vocational objective, albeit on a part-time basis. A designated school official at the school may authorize an eligible border commuter student to enroll in a course load below that otherwise required for a full course of study under paragraph (m)(9) of this section, provided that the reduced course load is consistent with the border commuter student's approved course of study.
(iii) Period of stay. An M-1 border commuter student is not entitled to an additional 30-day period of stay otherwise available under paragraph (m)(5) of this section.
(iv) Employment. A border commuter student may not be authorized to accept any employment in connection with his or her M-1 student status, except for practical training as provided in paragraph (m)(14) of this section.
(20) Remittance of the fee. An alien who applies for M-1 or M-3 nonimmigrant status in order to enroll in a program of study at a DHS-approved vocational educational institution is required to pay the SEVIS fee to DHS, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.13, except as otherwise provided in that section.

(a) Filing petition—
(1) General. A school or school system seeking initial or continued authorization for attendance by nonimmigrant students under sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act, or both, must file a petition for certification or recertification with SEVP, using the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), in accordance with the procedures at paragraph (h) of this section. The petition must state whether the school or school system is seeking certification or recertification for attendance of nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act or both. The petition must identify by name and address each location of the school that is included in the petition for certification or recertification, specifically including any physical location in which a nonimmigrant can attend classes through the school (i.e., campus, extension campuses, satellite campuses, etc.).
(i) School systems. A school system, as used in this section, means public school (grades 9-12) or private school (grades kindergarten-12). A petition by a school system must include a list of the names and addresses of those schools included in the petition with the supporting documents.
(ii) Submission requirements. Certification and recertification petitions require that a complete Form I-17, Petition for Approval of School for Attendance by Nonimmigrant Student, including supplements A and B and bearing original signatures, be included with the school's submission of supporting documentation. In submitting the Form I-17, a school certifies that the designated school officials (DSOs) signing the form have read and understand DHS regulations relating to: Nonimmigrant students at 8 CFR 214.1, 214.2(f), and/or 214.2(m); change of nonimmigrant classification for students at 8 CFR 248; school certification and recertification under this section; withdrawal of school certification under this section and 8 CFR 214.4; that both the school and its DSOs intend to comply with these regulations at all times; and that, to the best of its knowledge, the school is eligible for SEVP certification. Willful misstatements may constitute perjury (18 U.S.C. 1621).
(2) Approval for F-1 or M-1 classification, or both—(i) F-1 classification. The following schools may be approved for attendance by nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act:
(A) A college or university, i.e., an institution of higher learning which awards recognized bachelor's, master's doctor's or professional degrees.
(B) A community college or junior college which provides instruction in the liberal arts or in the professions and which awards recognized associate degrees.
(C) A seminary.
(D) A conservatory.
(E) An academic high school.
(F) A private elementary school.
(G) An institution which provides language training, instruction in the liberal arts or fine arts, instruction in the professions, or instruction or training in more than one of these disciplines.
(ii) M-1 classification. The following schools are considered to be vocational or nonacademic institutions and may be approved for attendance by nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act:
(A) A community college or junior college which provides vocational or technical training and which awards recognized associate degrees.
(B) A vocational high school.
(C) A school which provides vocational or nonacademic training other than language training.
(iii) Both F-1 and M-1 classification. A school may be approved for attendance by nonimmigrant students under both sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) and 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act if it has both instruction in the liberal arts, fine arts, language, religion, or the professions and vocational or technical training. In that case, a student whose primary intent is to pursue studies in liberal arts, fine arts, language, religion, or the professions at the school is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act. A student whose primary intent is to pursue vocational or technical training at the school is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act.
(iv) English language training for a vocational student. A student whose primary intent is to pursue vocational or technical training who takes English language training at the same school solely for the purpose of being able to understand the vocational or technical course of study is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act.
(v) The following may not be approved for attendance by foreign students:
(A) A home school,
(B) A public elementary school, or
(C) An adult education program, as defined by section 203(l) of the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, Public Law 105-220, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 9202(l), if the adult education program is funded in whole or in part by a grant under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, or by any other Federal, State, county or municipal funding.

(b) Supporting documents. Institutions petitioning for certification or recertification must submit certain supporting documents as follows, pursuant to sections 101(a)(15)(F) and (M) of the Act. A petitioning school or school system owned and operated as a public educational institution or system by the United States or a State or a political subdivision thereof shall submit a certification to that effect signed by the appropriate public official who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so. A petitioning private or parochial elementary or secondary school system shall submit a certification signed by the appropriate public official who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so to the effect that it meets the requirements of the State or local public educational system. Any other petitioning school shall submit a certification by the appropriate licensing, approving, or accrediting official who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so to the effect that it is licensed, approved, or accredited. In lieu of such certification a school which offers courses recognized by a State-approving agency as appropriate for study for veterans under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3675 and 3676 may submit a statement of recognition signed by the appropriate official of the State approving agency who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so. A charter shall not be considered a license, approval, or accreditation. A school catalogue, if one is issued, shall also be submitted with each petition. If not included in the catalogue, or if a catalogue is not issued, the school shall furnish a written statement containing information concerning the size of its physical plant, nature of its facilities for study and training, educational, vocational or professional qualifications of the teaching staff, salaries of the teachers, attendance and scholastic grading policy, amount and character of supervisory and consultative services available to students and trainees, and finances (including a certified copy of the accountant's last statement of school's net worth, income, and expenses). Neither a catalogue nor such a written statement need be included with a petition submitted by:
(1) A school or school system owned and operated as a public educational institution or system by the United States or a State or a political subdivision thereof;
(2) A school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; or
(3) A secondary school operated by or as part of a school so accredited.
(c) Other evidence. If the petitioner is a vocational, business, or language school, or American institution of research recognized as such by the Secretary of Homeland Security, it must submit evidence that its courses of study are accepted as fulfilling the requirements for the attainment of an educational, professional, or vocational objective, and are not avocational or recreational in character. If the petitioner is a vocational, business, or language school, or American institution of research recognized as such by the Attorney General, it must submit evidence that its courses of study are accepted as fulfilling the requirements for the attainment of an educational, professional, or vocational objective, and are not avocational or recreational in character. If the petitioner is an institution of higher education and is not within the category described in paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section, it must submit evidence that it confers upon its graduates recognized bachelor, master, doctor, professional, or divinity degrees, or if it does not confer such degrees that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three such institutions of higher learning. If the petitioner is an elementary or secondary school and is not within the category described in paragraph (b) (1) or (3) of this section, it must submit evidence that attendance at the petitioning institution satisfies the compulsory attendance requirements of the State in which it is located and that the petitioning school qualifies graduates for acceptance by schools of a higher educational level within the category described in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section.
(d) Interview of petitioner. The petitioner or an authorized representative of the petitioner may be required to appear in person before or be interviewed by telephone by a DHS representative prior to the adjudication of a petition for certification or recertification. The interview will be conducted under oath.
(e) Notices to schools related to certification or recertification petitions or to out-of-cycle review—(1) General. All notices from SEVP to schools or school systems related to school certification, recertification, or out-of-cycle review (including, but not limited to, notices related to the collection of evidence, testimony, and appearance pertaining to petitions for recertification encompassing compliance with the recordkeeping, retention and reporting, and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section, as well as to eligibility) will be served in accordance with the procedures at 8 CFR 103.2(b)(1), (4)-(16), (18) and (19), with the exception that all procedures will be conducted by SEVP, the SEVP Director, and the Assistant Secretary, ICE, as appropriate, and except as provided in this section. All such notices will be served (i.e., generated and transmitted) through SEVIS and/or by e-mail. The date of service is the date of transmission of the e-mail notice. DSOs must maintain current contact information, including current e-mail addresses, at all times. Failure of a school to receive SEVP notices due to inaccurate DSO e-mail addresses in SEVIS or blockages of the school's e-mail system caused by spam filters is not grounds for appeal of a denial or withdrawal. The term “in writing” means either a paper copy bearing original signatures or an electronic copy bearing electronic signatures.
(2) SEVP approval notification and SEVIS updating by certified schools. SEVP will notify the petitioner by updating SEVIS to reflect approval of the petition and by e-mail upon approval of a certification or recertification petition. The certification or recertification is valid only for the type of program and nonimmigrant classification specified in the certification or recertification approval notice. The certification must be recertified every two years and may be subject to out-of-cycle review at any time. Approval may be withdrawn in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4.
(3) Modifications to Form I-17 while a school is SEVP-certified. Any modification made by an SEVP-certified school on the Form I-17 at any time after certification and for the duration of a school's authorization to enroll F and/or M students must be reported to SEVP and will be processed by SEVP in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (f)(1), (g)(2) and (h)(3)(i) of this section.
(4) Notice of Intent to Withdraw (NOIW) SEVP certification—(i) Automatic withdrawal. SEVP will serve the school with an NOIW 30 days prior to a school's SEVP certification expiration date if the school has not submitted to SEVP a completed recertification petition, in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The school will be automatically withdrawn immediately, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(a)(3), if it has not submitted a completed recertification petition by the school's certification expiration date.
(ii) Withdrawal on notice. SEVP will serve a Withdrawal on Notice, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(b), if SEVP determines that a school reviewed out-of-cycle has failed to sustain eligibility or has failed to comply with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section. When a school fails to file an answer to an NOIW within the 30-day period, SEVP will withdraw the school's certification and notify the DSOs of the decision, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(d). Such withdrawal of certification may not be appealed.
(5) Notice of Denial. A Notice of Denial will be served to a school when SEVP denies a petition for initial certification or recertification. The notice will address appeals options. Schools denied recertification must comply with 8 CFR 214.4(i).
(6) Notice of Automatic Withdrawal. Schools that relinquish SEVP certification for any of the reasons cited in 8 CFR 214.4(a)(3) will be served a Notice of Automatic Withdrawal.
(7) Notice of Withdrawal. A school found to be ineligible for continued SEVP certification as a result of an out-of-cycle review will receive a Notice of Withdrawal. Schools withdrawn must comply with 8 CFR 214.4(i).
(8) Notice of SEVIS Access Termination Date. The Notice of SEVIS Access Termination Date gives the official date for the school's denial or withdrawal to be final and SEVIS access to be terminated. In most situations, SEVP will not determine a SEVIS access termination date for that school until the appeals process has concluded and the initial denial or withdrawal has been upheld, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(i)(3). The school will no longer be able to access SEVIS and SEVP will automatically terminate any remaining Active SEVIS records for that school on that date.
(f) Adjudication of a petition for SEVP certification or recertification — (1) Approval. The school is required to immediately report through SEVIS any change to its school information upon approval of a petition for SEVP certification or recertification. Modification to school information listed in paragraph (h)(3) of this section will require a determination of continued eligibility for certification. The certification or recertification is valid only for the type of program and student specified in the approval notice. The certification may be withdrawn in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.4, is subject to review at any time, and will be reviewed every two years.
(2) Denial. The petitioner will be notified of the reasons for the denial and appeal rights, in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR part 103 and 8 CFR 214.4, if SEVP denies a petition for certification or recertification.

(g) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements — (1) Student records. An SEVP-certified school must keep records containing certain specific information and documents relating to each F-1 or M-1 student to whom it has issued a Form I-20, while the student is attending the school and until the school notifies SEVP, in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, that the student is not pursuing a full course of study. Student information not required for entry in SEVIS may be kept in the school's student system of records, but must be accessible to DSOs. The school must keep a record of having complied with the reporting requirements for at least three years after the student is no longer pursuing a full course of study. The school must maintain records on the student in accordance with paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section if a school recommends reinstatement for a student who is out of status. The school must maintain records on the student for three years from the date of the denial if the reinstatement is denied. The DSO must make the information and documents required by this paragraph available, including academic transcripts, and must furnish them to DHS representatives upon request. Schools must maintain and be able to provide an academic transcript or other routinely maintained student records that reflect the total, unabridged academic history of the student at the institution, in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section. All courses must be recorded in the academic period in which the course was taken and graded. The information and documents that the school must keep on each student are as follows:
(i) Identification of the school, to include name and full address.
(ii) Identification of the student, to include name while in attendance (record any legal name change), date and place of birth, country of citizenship, and school's student identification number.
(iii) Current address where the student and his or her dependents physically reside. In the event the student or his or her dependents cannot receive mail at such physical residence, the school must provide a mailing address in SEVIS. If the mailing address and the physical address are not the same, the school must maintain a record of both mailing and physical addresses and provide the physical location of residence of the student and his or her dependents to DHS upon request.
(iv) Record of coursework. Identify the student's degree program and field of study. For each course, give the periods of enrollment, course identification code and course title; the number of credits or contact hours, and the grade; the number of credits or clock hours, and for credit hour courses the credit unit; the term unit (semester hour, quarter hour, etc.). Include the date of withdrawal if the student withdrew from a course. Show the grade point average for each session or term. Show the cumulative credits or clock hours and cumulative grade point average. Narrative evaluation will be accepted in lieu of grades when the school uses no other type of grading.
(v) Record of transfer credit or clock hours accepted. Type of hours, course identification, grades.
(vi) Academic status. Include the effective date or period if suspended, dismissed, placed on probation, or withdrawn.
(vii) Whether the student has been certified for practical training, and the beginning and end dates of certification.
(viii) Statement of graduation (if applicable). Title of degree or credential received, date conferred, program of study or major.
(ix) Termination date and reason.
(x) The documents referred to in paragraph (k) of this section.
Note to paragraph (g)(1): A DHS officer may request any or all of the data in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (x) of this section on any individual student or class of students upon notice. This notice will be in writing if requested by the school. The school will have three work days to respond to any request for information concerning an individual student, and ten work days to respond to any request for information concerning a class of students. The school will respond orally on the same day the request for information is made if DHS requests information on a student who is being held in custody, and DHS will provide a written notification that the request was made after the fact, if the school so desires. DHS will first attempt to gain information concerning a class of students from DHS record systems.
(2) Reporting changes in student and school information. (i) Schools must update SEVIS with the current information within 21 days of a change in any of the information contained in paragraphs (f)(1) and (h)(3) of this section.
(ii) Schools are also required to report within 21 days any change of the information contained in paragraph (g)(1) or the occurrence of the following events:
(A) Any student who has failed to maintain status or complete his or her program;
(B) A change of the student's or dependent's legal name or U.S. address;
(C) Any student who has graduated early or prior to the program end date listed on SEVIS Form I-20;
(D) Any disciplinary action taken by the school against the student as a result of the student being convicted of a crime; and
(E) Any other notification request not covered by paragraph (g)(1) of this section made by DHS with respect to the current status of the student.
(F) For F-1 students authorized by USCIS to engage in a 17-month extension of OPT,
(1) Any change that the student reports to the school concerning legal name, residential or mailing address, employer name, or employer address; and
(2) The end date of the student's employment reported by a former employer in accordance with §214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(4).
(iii) Each term or session and no later than 30 days after the deadline for registering for classes, schools are required to report the following registration information:
(A) Whether the student has enrolled at the school, dropped below a full course of study without prior authorization by the DSO, or failed to enroll;
(B) The current address of each enrolled student; and
(C) The start date of the student's next session, term, semester, trimester, or quarter. For initial students, the start date is the “program start date” or “report date.” (These terms are used interchangeably.) The DSO may choose a reasonable date to accommodate a student's need to be in attendance for required activities at the school prior to the actual start of classes when determining the report date on the Form I-20. Such required activities may include, but are not limited to, research projects and orientation sessions. The DSO may not, however, indicate a report date more than 30 days prior to the start of classes. The next session start date is the start of classes for continuing students.
(D) Adjustment to the program completion date. Any factors that influence the student's progress toward program completion (e.g., deferred attendance, authorized drop below, program extension) must be reflected by making an adjustment updating the program completion date.
(3) Administrative correction of a student's record. In instances where technological or computer problems on the part of SEVIS cause an error in the student's record, the DSO may request the SEVIS system administrator, without fee, to administratively correct the student's record.
(h) SEVP certification, recertification, out-of-cycle review, and oversight of schools—(1) Certification. A school seeking SEVP certification for attendance by nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(m)(i) of the Act must use SEVIS to file an electronic petition (which compiles the data for the Form I-17) and must submit the nonrefundable certification petition fee on-line.
(i) Filing a petition. The school must access the SEVP Web site at http://www.ice.gov/sevis to file a certification petition in SEVIS. The school will be issued a temporary ID and password in order to access SEVIS to complete and submit an electronic Form I-17. The school must submit the proper nonrefundable certification petition fee as provided in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1).
(ii) Site visit, petition adjudication and school notification. SEVP will conduct a site visit for each petitioning school and its additional schools or campuses. SEVP will contact the school to arrange the site visit. The school must comply with and complete the visit within 30 days after the date SEVP contacts the school to arrange the visit, or the petition for certification will be denied as abandoned. DSOs and school officials that have signed the school's Form I-17 petition must be able to demonstrate to DHS representatives how they obtain access to the regulations cited in the certification as part of the site visit. Paper or electronic access is acceptable. DSOs must be able to extract pertinent citations within the regulations related to their requirements and responsibilities. SEVP will serve a notice of approval and SEVIS will be updated to reflect the school's certification if SEVP approves the school's certification petition.
(iii) Certification denial. SEVP will serve a notice of denial in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section if a school's petition for certification is denied.
(2) Recertification. Schools are required to file a completed petition for SEVP recertification before the school's certification expiration date, which is two years from the date of their previous SEVP certification or recertification expiration date, except for the first recertification cycle after publication of the recertification rule. There is no recertification petition fee. SEVP will review a petitioning school's compliance with the recordkeeping, retention and reporting, and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section, as well as continued eligibility for certification, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(i) Filing of petition for recertification. Schools must submit a completed Form I-17 (including supplements A and B) using SEVIS, and submit a paper copy of the Form I-17 bearing original signatures of all officials. SEVP will notify all DSOs of a previously certified school 180 days prior to the school's certification expiration date that the school may submit a petition for recertification. A school may file its recertification petition at any time after receipt of this notification. A school must submit a complete recertification petition package, as outlined in the submission guidelines, by its certification expiration date. SEVP will send a notice of confirmation of complete filing or rejection to the school upon receipt of any filing of a petition for recertification.
(A) Notice of confirmation assures a school of uninterrupted access to SEVIS while SEVP adjudicates the school's petition for recertification. A school that has complied with the petition submission requirements will continue to have SEVIS access after its certification expiration date while the adjudication for recertification is pending. The school is required to comply with all regulatory recordkeeping, retention and reporting, and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section during the period the petition is pending.
(B) Notice of rejection informs a school that it must take prompt corrective action in regard to its recertification petition prior to its certification expiration date to ensure that its SEVIS access will not be terminated and its petition for recertification will be accepted for adjudication.
(ii) Consequence of failure to petition. SEVP will serve an NOIW to the school 30 days prior to a school's certification expiration date. SEVP will no longer accept a petition for recertification from the school and will immediately withdraw the school's certification if the school does not petition for recertification, abandons its petition, or does not submit a complete recertification petition package by the certification expiration date, in accordance with the automatic withdrawal criteria in 8 CFR 214.4(a)(3). The school must comply with 8 CFR 214.4(i) upon withdrawal.
(iii) School recertification process—(A) General. School recertification reaffirms the petitioning school's eligibility for SEVP certification and the school's compliance with recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section since its previous certification.
(B) Compliance. Assessment by SEVP of a school petitioning for recertification will focus primarily on overall school compliance, but may also include examination of individual DSO compliance as data and circumstances warrant. Past performance of these individuals, whether or not they continue to serve as principal designated school officials (PDSOs) or DSOs, will be considered in any petition for recertification of the school.
(C) On-site review for recertification. All schools are subject to on-site review, at the discretion of SEVP, in conjunction with recertification. The school must comply with and complete an on-site review within 30 days of the notification by a DHS representative of a school that it has been selected for an on-site review for recertification, or the petition for recertification will be denied as abandoned, resulting in the school's withdrawal from SEVIS.
(iv) Recertification approval. SEVP will serve a notice of approval if a school's petition for recertification is approved. The date of the subsequent recertification review will be two years after the school's certification expiration date from this petition cycle.
(v) Recertification denial. SEVP will serve a notice of denial if a school's petition for recertification is denied, in accordance with 8 CFR 103.3(a)(1)(i).
(vi) Adjustment of certification expiration date. Schools eligible for recertification before March 25, 2009 will, at a minimum, have their certification expiration date extended to March 25, 2009. SEVP may extend the certification expiration date beyond this date during the first cycle of recertification.
(3) Out-of-cycle review and oversight of SEVP-certified schools. (i) SEVP will determine if out-of-cycle review is required upon receipt in SEVIS of any changes from an SEVP-certified school to its Form I-17 information. The Form I-17 information that requires out-of-cycle review when changed includes:
(A) Approval for attendance of students (F/M/both);
(B) Name of school system; name of main campus;
(C) Mailing address of the school;
(D) Location of the school;
(E) School type;
(F) Public/private school indicator;
(G) Private school owner name;
(H) The school is engaged in;
(I) The school operates under the following Federal, State, Local or other authorization;
(J) The school has been approved by the following national, regional, or state accrediting association or agency;
(K) Areas of study;
(L) Degrees available from the school;
(M) If the school is engaged in elementary or secondary education;
(N) If the school is engaged in higher education;
(O) If the school is engaged in vocational or technical education;
(P) If the school is engaged in English language training;
(Q) Adding or deleting campuses;
(R) Campus name;
(S) Campus mailing address; and
(T) Campus location address.
(ii) SEVP may request a school to electronically update all Form I-17 fields in SEVIS and provide SEVP with documentation supporting the update. The school must complete such updates in SEVIS and submit the supporting documentation to SEVP within 10 business days of the request from SEVP.
(iii) SEVP may review a school's certification at any time to verify the school's compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section to verify the school's continued eligibility for SEVP certification pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section. SEVP may initiate remedial action with the school, as appropriate, and may initiate withdrawal proceedings against the school pursuant to 8 CFR 214.4(b) if noncompliance or ineligibility of a school is identified.
(iv) On-site review. SEVP-certified schools are subject to on-site review at any time. SEVP will initiate withdrawal proceedings against a certified school, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.4(b), if the certified school selected for on-site review prior to its certification expiration date fails to comply with and complete the review within 30 days of the date SEVP contacted the school to arrange the review.
(v) Notice of Continued Eligibility. SEVP will serve the school a notice of continued eligibility if, upon completion of an out-of-cycle review, SEVP determines that the school remains eligible for certification. Such notice will not change the school's previously-determined certification expiration date unless specifically notified by SEVP.
(vi) Withdrawal of certification. SEVP will institute withdrawal proceedings in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(b) if, upon completion of an out-of-cycle review, SEVP determines that a school or its programs are no longer eligible for certification.
(vii) Voluntary withdrawal. A school can voluntarily withdraw from SEVP certification at any time or in lieu of complying with an out-of-cycle review or request. Failure of a school to comply with an out-of-cycle review or request by SEVP will be treated as a voluntary withdrawal. A school must initiate voluntary withdrawal by sending a request for withdrawal on official school letterhead to SEVP.
(i) Administration of student regulations. DHS officials may conduct out-of-cycle, on-site reviews on the campuses of SEVP-certified schools to determine whether nonimmigrant students on those campuses are complying with DHS regulations pertaining to them, including the requirement that each maintains a valid passport. DHS officers will take appropriate action regarding violations of the regulations by nonimmigrant students.

(j) Advertising. In any advertisement, catalogue, brochure, pamphlet, literature, or other material hereafter printed or reprinted by or for an approved school, any statement which may appear in such material concerning approval for attendance by nonimmigrant students shall be limited solely to the following: This school is authorized under Federal law to enroll nonimmigrant alien students.
(k) Issuance of Certificate of Eligibility. A DSO of an SEVP-certified school must sign any completed Form I-20 issued for either a prospective or continuing student or a dependent. A Form I-20 issued by a certified school system must state which school within the system the student will attend. Only a DSO of an SEVP-certified school may issue a Form I-20 to a prospective student and his or her dependents, and only after the following conditions are met:
(1) The prospective student has made a written application to the school.
(2) The written application, the student's transcripts or other records of courses taken, proof of financial responsibility for the student, and other supporting documents have been received, reviewed, and evaluated at the school's location in the United States.
(3) The appropriate school authority has determined that the prospective student's qualifications meet all standards for admission.
(4) The official responsible for admission at the school has accepted the prospective student for enrollment in a full course of study.
(l) Designated Official. (1) Meaning of term Designated Official. As used in §§214.1(b), 214.2(b), 214.2(f), 214.2(m), and 214.4, a Designated Official, Designated School Official (DSO), or Principal Designated School Official (PDSO), means a regularly employed member of the school administration whose office is located at the school and whose compensation does not come from commissions for recruitment of foreign students. An individual whose principal obligation to the school is to recruit foreign students for compensation does not qualify as a designated official. The PDSO and any other DSO must be named by the president, owner, or head of a school or school system. The PDSO and DSO may not delegate this designation to any other person.
(i) A PDSO and DSO must be either a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States.
(ii) Each campus must have one PDSO. The PDSO is responsible for updating SEVIS to reflect the addition or deletion of any DSO on his or her associated campus. SEVP will use the PDSO as the point of contact on any issues that relate to the school's compliance with the regulations, as well as any system alerts generated by SEVIS. SEVP may also designate certain functions in SEVIS for use by the PDSO only. The PDSO of the main campus is the only DSO authorized to submit a Form I-17 for recertification. The PDSO and DSO will share the same responsibilities in all other respects.
(iii) School officials may nominate as many DSOs in addition to PDSOs as they determine necessary to adequately provide recommendations to F and/or M students enrolled at the school regarding maintenance of nonimmigrant status and to support timely and complete recordkeeping and reporting to DHS, as required by this section. School officials must not permit a DSO or PDSO nominee access to SEVIS until DHS approves the nomination.
(2) Name, title, and sample signature. Petitions for SEVP certification, review and recertification must include the names, titles, and sample signatures of designated officials. An SEVP-certified school must update SEVIS upon any changes to the persons who are principal or designated officials, and furnish the name, title and e-mail address of any new official within 21 days of the change. Any changes to the PDSO or DSO must be made by the PDSO within 21 days of the change. DHS may, at its discretion, reject the submission of any individual as a DSO or withdraw a previous submission by a school of an individual.
(3) Statement of designated officials. A petition for school approval must include a statement by each designated official certifying that the official is familiar with the Service regulations relating to the requirements for admission and maintenance of status of nonimmigrant students, change of nonimmigrant status under part 248 of this chapter, and school approval under §§214.3 and 214.4, and affirming the official's intent to comply with these regulations. At the time a new designated official is added, the designated official must make the same certification.

(a) General—(1) Denial of certification. The petitioning school will be notified of the reasons and appeal rights if a petition for certification is denied, in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 103.3(a)(1)(iii). A petitioning school denied certification may file a new petition for certification at any time.
(2) Denial of recertification or withdrawal on notice. The school must wait at least one calendar year from the date of denial of recertification or withdrawal on notice before being eligible to petition again for SEVP certification if a school's petition for recertification is denied by SEVP pursuant to 8 CFR 214.3(h)(3)(v), or its certification is withdrawn on notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. Eligibility to re-petition will be at the discretion of the Director of SEVP. SEVP certification of a school or school system for the attendance of nonimmigrant students, pursuant to sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) and/or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, will be withdrawn on notice subsequent to out-of-cycle review, or recertification denied, if the school or school system is determined to no longer be entitled to certification for any valid and substantive reason including, but not limited to, the following:
(i) Failure to comply with 8 CFR 214.3(g)(1) without a subpoena.
(ii) Failure to comply with 8 CFR 214.3(g)(2).
(iii) Failure of a DSO to notify SEVP of the attendance of an F-1 transfer student as required by 8 CFR 214.2(f)(8)(ii).
(iv) Failure of a DSO to identify on the Form I-20 which school within the system the student must attend, in compliance with 8 CFR 214.3(k).
(v) Willful issuance by a DSO of a false statement, including wrongful certification of a statement by signature, in connection with a student's school transfer or application for employment or practical training.
(vi) Conduct on the part of a DSO that does not comply with the regulations.
(vii) The designation as a DSO of an individual who does not meet the requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(l)(1).
(viii) Failure to provide SEVP paper copies of the school's Form I-17 bearing the names, titles, and signatures of DSOs as required by 8 CFR 214.3(l)(2).
(ix) Failure to submit statements of DSOs as required by 8 CFR 214.3(l)(3).
(x) Issuance of Forms I-20 to students without receipt of proof that the students have met scholastic, language, or financial requirements as required by 8 CFR 214.3(k)(2).
(xi) Issuance of Forms I-20 to aliens who will not be enrolled in or carry full courses of study, as defined in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6) or 214.2(m)(9).
(xii) Failure to operate as a bona fide institution of learning.
(xiii) Failure to employ adequate qualified professional personnel.
(xiv) Failure to limit advertising in the manner prescribed in 8 CFR 214.3(j).
(xv) Failure to maintain proper facilities for instruction.
(xvi) Failure to maintain accreditation or licensing necessary to qualify graduates as represented in the school's Form I-17.
(xvii) Failure to maintain the physical plant, curriculum, and teaching staff in the manner represented in the Form I-17.
(xviii) Failure to comply with the procedures for issuance of Forms I-20 as set forth in 8 CFR 214.3(k).
(xix) Failure of a DSO to notify SEVP of material changes, such as changes to the school's name, address, or curricular changes that represent material change to the scope of institution offerings (e.g., addition of a program, class or course for which the school is issuing Forms I-20, but which does not have Form I-17 approval), as required by 8 CFR 214.3(f)(1).
(3) Automatic withdrawal. A school that is automatically withdrawn and subsequently wishes to enroll nonimmigrant students in the future may file a new petition for SEVP certification at any time. The school must use the certification petition procedures described in 8 CFR 214.3(h)(1) to gain access to SEVIS for submitting its petition. Past compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l), and with the requirements for transition of students under paragraph (i) of this section will be considered in the evaluation of a school's subsequent petition for certification. SEVP certification will be automatically withdrawn:
(i) As of the date of termination of operations, if an SEVP-certified school terminates its operations.
(ii) As of a school's certification expiration date, if an SEVP-certified school does not submit a completed recertification petition in the manner required by 8 CFR 214.3(h)(2).
(iii) Sixty days after the change of ownership if an SEVP-certified school changes ownership, unless the school files a new petition for SEVP certification, in accordance with the procedures at 8 CFR 214.3(h)(1), within 60 days of the change of ownership. SEVP will review the petition if the school properly files such petition to determine whether the school still meets the eligibility requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(a)(3) and is still in compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l). SEVP will institute withdrawal proceedings in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section if, upon completion of the review, SEVP finds that the school is no longer eligible for certification, or is not in compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l).
(iv) If an SEVP-certified school voluntarily withdraws from its certification.
(4) Automatic withdrawal as of SEVIS mandatory compliance date. The present approval of any school that has not filed for enrollment in SEVIS by the mandatory compliance date for attendance of nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act is automatically withdrawn as of the day following the mandatory compliance date for SEVIS. Given the time necessary to conduct a review of each school, the Service will review and adjudicate Form I-17 petitions for approval in SEVIS prior to the SEVIS mandatory compliance date only for Form I-17 petitions filed at least 75 days prior to this mandatory date. If a Form I-17 petition is filed less than 75 days prior to the mandatory compliance date and is not adjudicated prior to the mandatory compliance date, the school will not be authorized to access SEVIS and will be unable to issue any SEVIS Forms I-20 until the adjudication is complete.
(b) Withdrawal on notice. SEVP will initiate an out-of-cycle review and serve the school with an NOIW if SEVP has information that a school or school system may no longer be entitled to SEVP certification prior to the school being due for its two-year recertification. The NOIW will inform the school of:
(1) The grounds for withdrawing SEVP certification.
(2) The 30-day deadline from the date of the service of the NOIW for the school to submit sworn statements, and documentary or other evidence, to rebut the grounds for withdrawal of certification in the NOIW. An NOIW is not a means for the school to submit evidence that it should have previously submitted as a part of its established reporting requirements.
(3) The school's right to submit a written request (including e-mail) within 30 days of the date of service of the NOIW for a telephonic interview in support of its response to the NOIW.
(c) Assistance of counsel. The school or school system shall also be informed in the notice of intent to withdraw approval that it may be assisted or represented by counsel of its choice qualified under part 292 of this chapter, at no expense to the Government, in preparation of its answer or in connection with the interview.
(d) Allegations admitted or no answer filed. If the school or school system admits all of the allegations in the notice of intent to withdraw approval, or if the school or school system fails to file an answer within the 30-day period, the district director shall withdraw the approval previously granted and he/she shall notify the designated school official of the decision. No appeal shall lie from the district director's decision if all allegations are admitted or no answer is filed within the 30-day period.
(e) Allegations denied. If the school or school system denies the allegations in the notice of intent to withdraw approval, then the school or school system shall, in its answer, provide all information or evidence on which the answer is based.
(f) Interview requested. (1) If in its answer to the notice of intent to withdraw approval the school or school system requests an interview, the school or school system shall be given notice of the date set for the interview.
(2) A summary of the information provided by the school or school system at the interview shall be prepared and included in the record. In the discretion of the district director, the interview may be recorded.
(g) Decision. The decision of SEVP will be in accordance with 8 CFR 103.3(a)(1).
(h) Appeals. Notices of denial or withdrawal of SEVP certification will include appeal alternatives and filing instructions. Any appeal must be taken within 15 days after the service of the decision by stating the reasons for the appeal in the notice of appeal provided with the instructions, and supported by a statement or brief specifically setting forth the grounds for contesting the withdrawal of the approval. No fee is required with appeals related to denial of SEVP recertification or withdrawal of SEVP certification.
(i) Operations at a school when SEVP certification is relinquished or withdrawn, or whose recertification is denied and on the SEVIS access termination date—(1) General. A school whose certification is relinquished or withdrawn, or whose recertification is denied may, at SEVP discretion, no longer be able to create Initial student records or issue new Forms I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student, for initial attendance. Schools must comply with the instructions given in the notice of withdrawal or denial with regard to management of status for their Initial and continuing F and/or M students. All other SEVIS functionality, including event reporting for students, will remain unchanged until the school's SEVIS access termination date. The school must continue to comply with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) until its SEVIS access termination date.
(2) SEVIS access termination. In determining the SEVIS access termination date, SEVP will consider the impact that such date will have upon SEVP, the school, and the school's nonimmigrant students in determining the SEVIS access termination date. In most situations, SEVP will not determine a SEVIS access termination date for that school until the appeals process has concluded and the initial denial or withdrawal has been upheld unless a school whose certification is withdrawn or whose recertification is denied is suspected of criminal activity or poses a potential national security threat. The school will no longer be able to access SEVIS, and SEVP will automatically terminate any remaining Active SEVIS records for that school on the SEVIS access termination date.
(3) Legal obligations and ramifications for a school and its DSOs when a school is having SEVP certification denied or withdrawn. Schools are obligated to their students to provide the programs of study to which they have committed themselves in the students' application for enrollment and acceptance process. Schools are obligated to the U.S. government to comply with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements contained in 8 CFR 214.3. With any new petition for SEVP certification, SEVP will consider the extent to which a school has fulfilled these obligations to students and the U.S. government during any previous period of SEVP certification.

(e) Circumstances where no new fee is required.
(1) Extension of stay, transfer, or optional practical training for students. An F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 nonimmigrant is not required to pay a new fee in connection with:
(i) An application for an extension of stay, as provided in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(7) or (m)(10);
(ii) An application for transfer, as provided in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(8) or (m)(11);

(4) Certain changes in student classification.
(i) No fee is required for changes between the F-1 and F-3 classifications, and no fee is required for changes between the M-1 and M-3 classifications.
(ii) Institutional reclassification. DHS retains the discretionary authority to waive the additional fee requirement when a nonimmigrant changes classification between F and M, if the change of status is due solely to institutional reclassification by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program during that nonimmigrant's course of study.
(5) Re-application following denial of application by consular officer. An alien who fully paid a SEVIS fee in connection with an initial application for an F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 visa, or a J-1 visa in a particular program category, whose initial application was denied, and who is reapplying for the same status, or the same J-1 exchange visitor category, within 12 months following the initial notice of denial is not required to repay the SEVIS fee.
(6) Re-application following denial of an application for a change of status. A nonimmigrant who fully paid a SEVIS fee in connection with an initial application for a change of status within in the United States to F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 classification, or for a change of status to a particular J-1 exchange visitor category, whose initial application was denied, and who is granted a motion to reopen the denied case is not required to repay the SEVIS fee if the motion to reopen is granted within 12 months of receipt of initial notice of denial.
(f) [Reserved]
(g) Procedures for payment of the SEVIS fee. (1) Options for payment. An alien subject to payment of a fee under this section may pay the fee by any procedure approved by DHS, including:
(2) Receipts. DHS will provide a receipt for each fee payment under paragraph (g)(1) of this section until such time as DHS issues a notice in the Federal Register that paper receipts will no longer be necessary. Further receipt provisions include:
(3) Electronic record of fee payment. DHS will maintain an electronic record of payment for the alien as verification of receipt of the required fee under this section. If DHS records indicate that the fee has been paid, an alien who has lost or did not receive a receipt for a fee payment under this section will not be denied an immigration benefit, including visa issuance or admission to the United States, solely because of a failure to present a paper receipt of fee payment.
(4) Third-party payments. DHS will accept payment of the required fee for an alien from an approved school or a designated exchange visitor program sponsor, or from another source, in accordance with procedures approved by DHS.
(h) Failure to pay the fee. The failure to pay the required fee is grounds for denial of F, M, or J nonimmigrant status or status-related benefits. Payment of the fee does not preserve the lawful status of any F, J, or M nonimmigrant that has violated his or her status in some other manner.

Applying for the F-1 Student Visa,"You must apply for your visa well in advance of your arrival, as it can in some instances take several weeks and occasionally longer, to obtain the F-1 student visa.
Although the U.S. Department of State states that F-1 student visas can be issued up to 365 days in advance of the program start date, OISS can only start the process to issue your immigration document after you accept your offer of admission and we receive your student record from your Yale school, which usually does not happen until March in most cases. Check the website of the consulate where you will apply for a visa for detailed instructions.
Before you begin the visa application process, you must have the following documents:
This will be sent to you in the mail from Yale after you have been admitted. Your I-20 is required when applying for an F-1 student visa at an American embassy or consulate and for entry into the United States. This I-20 has been produced by Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and is an acknowledgement that your record is in the SEVIS system. The form includes your SEVIS ID number, which is the number in the upper corner above the bar code, (usually starts with an N).
Thoroughly review your I-20 to make sure all of the information is correct. Sign the form at the bottom of page 1. If you have any questions, please contact your OISS adviser.
All new students coming in F-1 status must pay a one-time SEVIS fee prior to applying for your visa, and must submit the SEVIS fee receipt as part of their application. You can find instructions about paying the fee on this page. If you are renewing your F-1 visa it is recommended that you have proof of SEVIS fee payment, even though it does not have to be paid again. You can view and print the receipt by clicking “Check I-901 Status” at the top of this page.
If you have family members traveling with you in F-2 status, Yale will mail an I-20 for their use. Each F-2 dependent should have their own I-20 form. Each F-2 dependent I-20 is issued their own SEVIS number but an additional SEVIS fee does not need to be paid for a dependent.
The first step in applying for a U.S. visa is the online application DS-160.
Access the DS-160 application at the Consular Electronic Application Center website.
Watch an overview of the online application process.
Read Frequently Asked Questions about the DS-160.
Below are suggested answers you are welcome to use when you fill out this form. Please be aware that you are ultimately responsible for the accuracy of information you provide in this form.
If you know where you will stay, use that address. If you have not yet secured your housing at the time of your visa appointment you may choose one of the below:
List your primary source of funding as it appears on your I-20/DS-2019.
The next step in applying for a U.S. visa is making an appointment at your closest U.S. embassy or consulate. It is generally recommended that you apply for a visa in your home country rather than a third country if possible.
At this appointment you will need to present the following documents:
Check the website of the U.S. consulate/embassy where you are applying to see if there are other requirements.
An application fee and an interview will also be required. There have been (and continue to be) changes in the visa application process and these changes are usually reflected on the consular websites.
Find the nearest U.S. Consulate or Embassy.
Find the visa appointment wait times at your local consulate.
Attend your scheduled visa interview at your U.S. embassy or consulate. Here are 10 points to remember when applying for a non-immigrant visa.
Check the visa in your passport to make sure that all the information on it is correct. If the information is not correct it can only be changed at the embassy or consulate that issued your visa.
Your I-20 should be returned to you. You will need it to enter the U.S.
When applying for your student visa, pay careful attention to the following.
You may enter the U.S. no more than 30 days prior to the starting date noted on the I-20 form. If you try to enter the U.S. more than 30 days before this starting date, you may not be permitted to enter the U.S.
You must pay particular attention to the starting date noted on your I-20 form, as you must enter the U.S. by this date. If you cannot enter the U.S. by this date, please get in touch with OISS about the process for changing your start date.
The expiration date on your visa may not match the end date of your degree program. If your visa expires before you complete your degree program, you will apply for a new visa on your first trip outside the U.S. after your current visa expires.
If the U.S. consulate has any questions regarding your studies at Yale, please contact OISS. If your visa application is delayed or denied for any reason, please email your OISS adviser immediately. Safe travels and we look forward to meeting you when you arrive in New Haven!

Student Visa


Exchange Visitor Visa


Generally, a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

Generally, a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

To enter the United States to attend:
You need the following visa category:
University or college
F
High School
Private elementary school
Seminary
Conservatory
Another academic institution, including a language training program
Vocational or other recognized nonacademic institution, other than a language training program
M


Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.

"F-1 Visas for International Students: Requirements, Rules ...","Get ready to study abroad in America with our step-by-step guide to F-1 visa rules. 
Students wishing to study in the United States need to learn about the F-1 student visa application process. There are more than one million international students currently studying abroad in the USA, and with some preparation and guidance, you can join them. To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. The I-20 form provided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with your F-1 visa after graduation.
Have questions about the student visa process? Attend an upcoming Shorelight webinar > 
There are several F-1 visa rules to keep in mind if you plan to apply for a F-1 student visa. You must meet these requirements for your application to be accepted:
Institution certification—The college or the university where you plan to study needs to be approved by SEVP Immigration & Customs Enforcement.
Full-time enrollment—You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution while your academic term is in session.
English language proficiency—You must meet the required English language proficiency score of the institution you are attending or be enrolled in courses that will help you improve your English proficiency.
Sufficient funding—You must prove you have sufficient funds available to finance your studies and living expenses while in the US.
Valid passport—Your passport should be valid for US travel for at least six months after your program completion date.
Home country residency—You are required to have a residence in your home country to return to following the completion of your degree.

Before you begin your F-1 visa application, you must take the following steps:
Get accepted by a SEVP-certified institution before submitting your visa application. When you are accepted, you will receive your I-20 form, which you will need to apply for your F-1 visa.
Pay your SEVIS fee.
Complete your DS-160 visa application.
Schedule your visa interview.
Attend your visa interview.
If you are applying for a F-1 visa from India, Shorelight’s F-1 visa for Indian students guide is for you.
Once these steps are completed, you will be ready to complete and submit your F-1 student visa application. 
1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US government’s way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education. 
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay. 
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials. 
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., like getting a US driver’s license). 
Helpful resources: Confirm your US university is a SEVP-accredited institution 
Keep your Shorelight enrollment advisor updated through every step of the visa process – when you submit your application, schedule your visa interview, and, of course, when your visa application is approved.
2. Pay Your SEVIS Fee
The total cost for your F-1 student visa will be approximately $510, which includes the cost of the visa itself, plus SEVIS processing and maintenance fees. 
Requirements: Your I-20
Cost: $350 
Where to apply: Payment portal for your SEVIS fee
Make sure to save the I-901 SEVIS fee receipt. You will need it for your visa interview. 
3. Complete Your DS-160 Visa Application
Your DS-160 is your visa application. All prospective international students must complete a DS-160 to receive an F-1 visa. 
Requirements: Your I-20, passport, travel itinerary, photo for your visa
Cost: $160 
Where to apply: Application portal for your DS-160
After you successfully submit your DS-160, you will receive a printed confirmation with a barcode on it. Save this form – you will need it for your visa interview. 
4. Schedule Your Visa Interview
Find the nearest US embassy or consulate and schedule your visa interview. Wait times will vary by country and can take months — so remember to set up your appointments as early as possible!
If you are enrolling at a US university through Shorelight, ask your enrollment advisor about student visa interview tips or how to set up a mock interview session. Practicing your visa interview in advance will make you feel more comfortable with the process.
Ask your Shorelight advisor to set up a mock visa interview for you.
5. Attend Your Visa Interview
During the interview portion of the F-1 visa application process, the US consulate or embassy confirms you are coming to study as a legitimate, serious student. In your visa interview, you must also prove you have the funds to cover your time studying in the US, and confirm that you plan on returning home after your studies are complete. Attending your visa interview in person is required, though there are a few rare exceptions (e.g., if you are younger than 14 or older than 80 years of age, or if you meet certain visa renewal requirements). 
Cost: Your DS-160 payment covers the cost
Where to apply: Scheduling portal for your visa interview
After you successfully complete your visa interview, you will be granted your F-1 visa and acquire F-1 status. You are now cleared to study in the USA! 
Refer to Travel.state.gov to learn more. If you need any help with preparing or submitting your application, Shorelight provides application assistance for international students.
Before you attend your visa interview, make sure to have the following documents ready for evaluation by the consular officer:
A valid passport
A copy of the photo you will use for your visa
Printed copies of your DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmations
I-20 form
School transcript and official test scores cited on your university application
Diploma (if applicable)
Bank statements or other proof of finances
During your interview, the consular officer may request additional documents. To prepare, consider bringing the following documents:
Academic records such as transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates from schools you attended
Standardized test scores required by your US institution
Evidence of your intent to depart the United States upon completion of your course of study
Statements proving your ability to pay all educational, living, and travel costs
As an international student, you might feel uncertain about your upcoming interview. While feeling nervous is normal, do not forget to take a deep breath and remember that you are well prepared! Your interview is important, but should not be stressful.
Your interviewer will ask questions to determine: 
Are you a legitimate student?
Do you have the resources to pay for your studies?
Do you plan to return home after completing your degree?
To prepare for your F-1 student visa interview, here are some questions you might be asked: 
Why did you pick this university?
Which other US universities did you apply to?
How will you pay for your education?
Do you have relatives in the USA?
Do you plan to work while in the USA?
What do you plan to do after graduation?
Your Shorelight advisor can help you prepare for your interview by giving you a detailed overview of what the process will involve. They can also help you practice with mock interviews! Shorelight’s F-1 student visa interview guide can also help you learn more about what you can do to prepare for your upcoming interview. 
There is a possibility that your F-1 visa application will be denied. If this happens, you will be given detailed reasoning in writing, including the section of the law that led to the denial of your application.  
To avoid having your F-1 student visa application denied, it is important to read and follow all instructions carefully. Always double- and triple-check your documents before submitting your application. Shorelight advisors can offer visa assistance to make this process easier for you: They are happy to help you organize all the documents you will need, in the correct formats, and on schedule. 
Remember: During your F-1 student visa interview, you want to sufficiently demonstrate that you are traveling to the US to study and planning to return to your home country once your program is complete. Keep this in mind as you answer your interview questions.
As an international student, you must actively maintain your F-1 status to continue studying in the US. To do this, you must comply with both university regulations and codes of conduct, as well as with the requirements and conditions set out in your F-1 visa requirements. 
When entering the US:
Make sure to enter the US no more than 30 days before your program begins.
As soon as you arrive in the country, contact your designated school official (DSO).
When you arrive at your university, contact your DSO again before the start date listed on your I-20 form.
While studying in the US:
Attend all your classes and maintain good academic standing. If you require support with any of your classes, your Shorelight advisor can direct you to academic resources to help you improve.
If you need extra time to complete your program which would exceed the end date specified in your I-20, speak with your DSO to discuss your options for possible extensions.
Make sure to enroll for a full course of study when your academic term is in session.
If you want to drop a class or change classes, make sure to speak to your DSO first.
If you want to take a break and/or go on vacation, remember to first complete at least one full academic year at your institution.  After your holiday, you must also register for classes in the next academic term.
Yes, you will be able to work in the US on a F-1 student visa. However, you will have to follow certain F-1 visa rules and restrictions:
You can only work part time on campus while your academic term is in session
You can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week
You may be able to work off campus with the approval of your university
During academic breaks, you will be permitted to work full time, if your university allows it. You can learn more about working as a F-1 international student by referring to USCIS.gov.
When searching for work while you study, make sure to seek approval from your DSO first. 
Keep in mind, once you finish your program, you will have a grace period of 60 days to leave the US. If you wish to extend your stay, you can speak to a Shorelight advisor to explore your options, such as transferring to another school or pursuing further education. You can also refer to Shorelight’s F-1 extension guide to have a look at your options.
Now that you know how US non-immigrant visas work for international students, create a checklist of next steps and get started. The sooner you begin fulfilling the USA study visa requirements, the better chance you will have of securing your spot at an American university.

	Once you’re accepted, you will be required to pay the SEVIS I-901 Fee in order to be enrolled in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). Then, your school will provide you with a Form I-20. This form will be presented to the consular officer when you attend your F1 visa interview. If your spouse and/or children plan to reside in the USA with you while you study, they will be required to have individual Form I-20s, but they will not need to be enrolled in the SEVIS.


	Applying for the F1 student visa may vary depending on the U.S. embassy or consulate you are dealing with. You will be required to pay a non-refundable visa application fee. There is an online visa application available, which allows you to complete and print the Form DS-160 to take to your F1 visa interview.


	You can schedule your F1 visa interview with the U.S. embassy or consulate. Wait times for interview appointments vary by location, season, and visa category, so you should apply for your visa early. An F1 student visa for the USA can be issued up to 120 days in advance of your course of study start date. You will only be able to enter the US with an F1 visa 30 days before your start date.

The following documents are required for your F1 visa interview:

	Additional documents may be requested to prove your eligibility for the F1 student visa, including academic transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates. Test scores such as the TOEFL, SAT, GRE, or GMAT may also be requested, as well as proof of your intent to depart the U.S. after your program is complete and proof of your financial stability.


	Your F1 visa interview will determine whether you are qualified to receive an F1 student visa for the USA. Assuming that you have prepared the appropriate documents and meet all of the F1 visa requirements, your visa will be approved at the discretion of the consular officer.


	You may be required to pay a visa issuance fee. Digital fingerprint scans will be taken for records. Your passport will be taken so that you can get your visa and you will be informed when you can get it back, either by pick-up or in the mail.


	Keep in mind that visa issuance is not guaranteed. Never make final travel plans until you have your visa approved. If your visa is denied, you will be given a reason based on the section of law which applies to your ineligibility. Filing a waiver of ineligibility is possible in some cases.

US student visa requirements, eligibility criteria, the application steps and FAQs
In this article
The F1 visa is a student visa that is given to international students who want to attend educational institutions in the United States. It covers levels from elementary school to university and graduate school, including other degrees.
To qualify to even apply for an F1 visa you must meet some specific conditions, such as:
Here are the documents required to apply for an F1 Visa:
To application process for the F1 visa goes through the following steps:
After you apply and are accepted into the school you want to attend, they will have to complete some procedures so that you can apply for the F1 visa. The most important document you need to have is Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status. Without this form, you will not be able to apply for an F1 student visa and attend your interview.
After you get your Form I-20, you can start the usual application process. This includes filing the DS-160 form online with the necessary information about your visa status.
The application fee for the student visa is $185. You must pay this fee and get the receipt, which you will need later for your interview documents. You might have to pay additional fees based on your country of origin and the US Embassy you are applying from.
When you are admitted by the SEVP institution, your school immediately registers you in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). To have full registration, there is a SEVIS I-901 fee. For the F1 visa, this fee is $200.
After filing the DS-160 form and paying the fees, you will need to schedule your interview. The interview is a mandatory step before you get your student visa. Try to schedule it as early as possible, since there might be delays due to the heavy workload of the US Embassy. When you schedule it, you will receive an interview appointment letter which you will need later on in the application process.
Before you go to attend your interview, you should prepare your file with the required documents for students.
When you go to attend the student visa interview, the questions will mostly revolve around your reasons for going to the US and the institution you are going to. The interviewer will try to assess whether you intend to return to your home country after you complete your degree.
When your visa is approved, it might be for the full time that you will be in school in the US, or for less. If your study program takes 1 year to graduate, the Embassy will most likely give you a visa that is valid for 1 year If your degree program is 2 years and you only get the visa for 1 year, you should then later apply to renew it. In this case, it is the best option to renew the F1 visa.
The validity of your F1 visa is for as long as it is stated on your I-20 form and I-94 form which is given to you when you enter the US.
If you are renewing your visa you should follow the same procedure. You might be able to waive the interview on the reason that you have already done it once and your intent is to continue your education for the remaining years to get your degree.
If your visa is approved, you are allowed to depart for the US 30 days before your program begins. You cannot enter the US any earlier than that.
In most cases, you will get the response on this visa immediately after the interview. At the end of the visa interview, the interviewer might congratulate you for getting the visa or will provide you with a document letting you know the reason for denial. This is because the processing of this type of visa actually happens before your interview. The interview is the last step for the US Embassy to assess whether they should issue the visa.
There are, however, cases where the response and processing of the F1 visa takes a few days, so you should be patient if that happens.
After you are admitted into the institution of your choice, you can apply for the visa 120 days before you are scheduled to start your program. You cannot apply any earlier, but applying later might cause you a delay due to processing times. So as soon as the 120-day countdown begins, make sure you submit your application.
After your visa expires, you have a 60 day grace period to prepare for your departure to your home country. If your visa doesn’t cover the whole time that you will be in school in the US, you will have to apply for renewal or extensions. The extensions are approved only if you can prove you will be completing your degree in the US and you intend to return as soon as it is over.
You may work as an F1 student but only for short periods of time since your visa is a student and not a work visa. You are allowed to work part-time on campus while school is in session and full time during breaks. If you want to work outside of campus, you have two options.
If you, for example, find a job that requires a different type of visa, other than F1, then you are also eligible to change status. You just need to work through the instructions of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and your employer or another petitioner.
Even though you have proved that you have strong ties to your home country, if you want to apply for a Green Card, you are allowed to do so on an F1 visa. It is a complicated procedure, though. You must either self-petition as a person with extraordinary abilities, get married in the US or prove that you will invest $500,000 in the US economy.
If these are not feasible for you, but you still want to remain in the US, the easiest way is to change status into a different type of visa such as an H-1B visa and have your employer sponsor you.
F1 visa students quite often have to travel abroad. They travel during university breaks or in case of emergencies. The travel can be to their own home countries or to other countries.
If you are an F1 visa student who wants to travel abroad, before you plan and book their travel you must follow some instructions. The instructions are to ensure that they can enter the United States again.
In case you have dependents, such as a spouse or unmarried children under 21 years old, they are allowed to come to the US too. This can be done with an F2 visa.
The F2 visa has no cap and dependents should just fulfill the requirements and complete the application procedures to get the visa. To be eligible for an F-2 visa, you must fulfill the following criteria:

"The F-1 Student Visa, Explained","Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
What is the F-1 visa?
The F-1 visa allows a student to temporarily live in the United States for a defined period of time while studying at a school, college, seminary, or conservatory.
Is the F-1 visa right for me?
For many students, the chance to study in the United States is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. Unless the person is already a U.S. citizen or green card holder, all prospective students will have to apply for a visa to study in the United States.
Because there are so many courses and places to study in the United States, the F-1 visa has a pretty broad application but also some very clear rules. The first is that you have to be coming to the United States with the intent to temporarily study. In other words, this is not an immigrant visa.
You must be studying at an academic institution, not training at a vocational school, as this will require an M-1 visa. Your academic institution must be approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning it needs to be accredited to be able to accept foreign students on F-1 visas.
You will be able to work, but because this is a non-immigrant visa, you will be restricted to where you can work and the type of work. Finally, although your spouse and children can come with you, they will not be able to work but your children can enroll in schools. They will be on F-2 visas and tied to your visa’s status.
Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have. Learn more about what we do to help.
The requirements for an F-1 visa are:
For many students, the process of applying and being accepted into a U.S. academic institution is the lengthiest part. The visa process is a series of steps that take place after you accept an enrollment offer. Not sure if you qualify for an F-1 student visa? Start by checking your eligibility.
Congratulations, you have been accepted into a course of study by a U.S. academic institution! Years of hard work probably led you to this milestone, so here’s the process to obtain your student visa.
After your SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be added to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVP uses SEVIS to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M, and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.
Once you have registered with SEVIS, you will need to pay the I-901 fee. This fee is currently $350 for most people, and funds the SEVP program.
Your SEVP-approved school will then issue you a Form I-20. This form is incredibly important as it confirms your acceptance at the school, and therefore your eligibility for the F-1 visa. Once this Form I-20 has been issued, you will be able to apply to a U.S. embassy or consulate for your F-1 visa.
The steps required will vary between different U.S. embassies or consulates, so make sure you check their websites for further information.
However, you must complete the Form DS-160, which is similar to the Form DS-260 for immigrant visas. The form is very detailed and can take some time to fill in, so make sure you set aside plenty of time to complete it.
Once you have completed the Form DS-160, you will need to schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, unless you are under 13 years of age or over 80 years of age. The U.S. Department of State says you should schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country where you live. You may schedule your interview at another U.S. embassy or consulate, but be aware that it may be more difficult to qualify for a visa outside of the country where you live.
Prior to your interview, you will need to pay the $185 application fee and also, depending on your nationality, pay an issuance fee, as well. The visa issuance fee is only due after your interview, if your visa is approved. The next step will be an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate.
Visa wait times can vary depending on the time of year and location. You can use the appointment wait time tool to see how long you will have to wait for an appointment at a specific U.S. embassy or consulate.
At this stage, it is important to note that F-1 visas for new students can only be issued up to 365 days (one year) in advance of the start date for a course of study. It used to be 120 days, but in February, 2023, the State Department extended the period.
Note: For existing F-1 visas, this is not the case and visas can be issued any time, as long as the student is currently enrolled at a SEVP-approved school or institution and in SEVIS.

You will generally be required to attend an interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate. You will need to bring:
You should also be prepared to bring evidence of:
During your interview, the consular officer will ask you questions to determine whether or not to approve your F-1 visa. Make sure you are complete and accurate in your answers, as you will be under oath. For interview tips, see the Boundless guide on preparing for the F-1 student visa interview.
The consular officer will also take your fingerprints, although this will vary depending on your location. After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing. The consular officer will let you know if this is required.
Once your interview is complete, you will be informed of the outcome and, if successful, be issued a visa to study in the United States.

Yes, you can bring your spouse and children with you. Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
F-1 students cannot work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students can engage in three types of off-campus employment:
This depends on your individual taxation situation, but typically you might be required to file a U.S. tax return. For more information, seek advice from a qualified tax professional.
Generally, an F-1 student may transfer between SEVP-certified schools. However, this does involve paperwork and coordination. See here for more detailed instructions.
There are some programs and visas available for F-1 visa holders after you finish studying in the United States. These can be highly individual to your circumstances, field of study, and professional background, so do your research carefully.

What is an F1 student visa? Application process and ...,"Homepage > MBA Admissions > What is an F1 student visa? Application process and interview tips
Posted by Suheb Hussain | Oct 10, 2022 | About MBA, MBA Admissions
Congrats on having received admissions offer from a US university. Your next big milestone is navigating the visa process. Most international students applying to US universities need to possess an F1 (or “student”) visa in order to legally study in the United States. An F1 visa is far from a guarantee as 15-20% of applicants get rejected by visa officers every year despite having admissions offers from US universities. But, Fret not.
In this article, Shaarang, a current MBA student at UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School, outlines a few key facts to know about the F1 visa process from his own experience of applying for the visa. You can also watch this short video:
An F1 visa allows international students to pursue a full-time education in the United States. With an F 1 visa, you can study full-time in a:
You must apply for an F1 Visa if:
A student Visa will let you attend a top business school like Harvard Business School and Stanford GSB. Learn more on how to get into a top US business school.
Learn what can international students expect from the Biden administration.
You should reserve a 3-month window for your entire F1 visa process. The wait times for visa appointments fluctuate depending on what part of the world you live in and can range from 1 week to 2 months, so it is prudent to err on the side of caution. 
It is also best to select a visa appointment date that is not too close to your preferred departure date. Assuming that you are approved for the visa, you will not walk out of the embassy or consulate with a stamped passport. 
Your passport will be retained by the visa officer and may take between 7 and 14 days for the visa to get stamped on your passport and arrive at your doorstep. It is critical that you take these administrative processing times into account when booking your visa appointment.
Once you have booked your visa appointment, you must start collecting documents that prove that you can support your education in the United States. 
A visa officer may ask for any of these documents during your interview and it is critical that have these proofs handy; on that note, it is a best practice to organize your documents in a transparent accordion folder. Such folders are among the only ones permitted inside the embassy gates.
The documents you collect should include:

Choosing the right MBA program for you is very important if you want to derive the maximum benefit. Learn the 6-step process of choosing the right business school.
When booking a date for your visa appointment, you will be asked to book two different dates. 
The first date will be for your biometric appointment and the second date will be for the visa interview. Your biometric center and the embassy or consulate (where the visa interview will be held) are two separate premises and may be located in different parts of the city. You should research this before booking your appointments. 
For both appointments show up 30-minutes before the scheduled time to ensure a smooth process.
For your biometric appointment, you may be dressed in casual attire but be sure to carry the documents in the “Official documents” section of your accordion folder. 
You will be asked to fill out some basic forms and you will need to log in your finger and thumb prints and pose for a picture. Assuming there is no wait time, this appointment lasts 15-minutes and is fairly straightforward.
For your visa interview, you will report to a US embassy or consulate. Please carry all the documents mentioned above and dress in business casual attire. It is important to make a good impression during the visa interview. You will be asked to wait in a waiting area until your name is called when you will step into a booth for your visa interview.
The visa interview itself lasts for less than two minutes. The visa officers are trained to detect deception and are asked to err on the side of safety and reject the application if they feel unsure about an applicant — they are asked to not give applicants second chances. 
Recognizing that a visa interview is a high stakes situation, it is important to prepare rigorously and is also important for your answers to drive home two points: first, that you want the visa to build skills and not accept a job in the US, and second, that you do intend to return to your home country when your stint in the US comes to an end. (A student visa is a non-immigrant visa, so it is critical to emphasize that you do not wish to immigrate to the United States — any doubts on this front will surely lead to rejection.)
Some commonly asked F1 visa interview questions include:
Your visa interview will have one of three outcomes: “Visa Approved”, “Visa Rejected”, “Visa kept on hold under administrative processing”
If your visa is approved, your passport will be retained by the visa officer and may take between 7 and 14 days for the visa to get stamped on your passport and arrive at your doorstep. 
If your visa is rejected, your passport will be returned to you immediately and you may book another appointment and interview with a different visa officer who may approve your visa. 
If your visa is placed under administrative processing, your passport is retained and sent to the biometrics center, where you are required to produce additional documents, after which your visa will be stamped and your passport returned to you.
No. F 1 visa only allows you to travel. However, your spouse and children under 21 can travel on an F 2 visa.
Your spouse cannot work on an F 2 visa. However, your children can enroll in primary or secondary school programs.
You can. You will need to transfer your SEVIS record and get another I-20 form from the new school within 15 days of the transfer.
You can travel back to your home country or another country as long as you return to the US within 5 months.
You can, only if you are authorized for an OPT (Optional Practical Training) program. With an OPT you can stay back for 12 more months (36 months in the case of STEM students). In case you are not authorized for the OPT, you’ll only have an additional 60 days to stay in the US after academic program completion.
You can transfer your F 1 visa to H1-B or a green card. To get an H1-B visa you need to find a sponsor. An H1-B visa allows you to work for up to 6 years.
If you plan to do an MBA from the USA, you need to score well on the GMAT.
If you are planning to take the GMAT, we can help you with a personalized study plan and give you access to quality online content to prepare.

Each year, many international students apply to US schools to study full-time in the US. But to attend school in the States, you need more than just good grades — you need a US student visa. Unfortunately, the process for obtaining a visa can be complicated, which is why we're here to help.
In this guide, we'll go over the basics of visas and how to get a student visa to the US. We'll also give you a handful of tips and resources you can use to ensure your visa application process proceeds smoothly.

 
In order to legally attend school in the US, all international applicants — that is, those without US citizenship or permanent residence — must first obtain a US student visa. This international student visa allows you to reside temporarily in the US in order to attend an approved school, language program, or academic exchange program.
Your student visa ends once you complete your program. At that time, you must depart the US. (However, you may later return to the US as a tourist or on another visa, such as a work visa.)
There are three types of US student visas:
Generally speaking, international students who wish to study full-time in an undergraduate or graduate program will need an F-1 visa. By contrast, if you're interested in studying abroad for only a semester or two at a US institution (and want to receive credits that go toward your home institution), you'll need to apply for a J-1 visa.
 
You may only apply for a student visa after you’ve applied for and been accepted to an SEVP-approved school. (SEVP stands for the Student Exchange and Visitor Program. All US schools that enroll F-1 and/or M-1 students must be certified by this program.) Once you’ve secured admission to the school you wish to attend, you can begin the visa application process.
Note that you must receive your visa before your program start date. While you can receive your US student visa up to 120 days before your program start date, you may not travel to the US on this visa until 30 days before your start date.
 

 
Before we explain how to apply for a student visa, let’s briefly go over the specific items you should have in order.
 
Every international student must possess a valid passport issued by his or her home country. This passport must also be valid until at least six months beyond the end date of your program in the US. So any passport that will expire during your stay in the US or shortly after your program ends may not be used. Rather, you'll need to apply for a new passport and use that one instead.
Passport procedures and costs vary by country. Check your country's government website for details on obtaining or renewing a passport.
 
As part of your application, you must submit a recent (within the past six months) passport-style photograph. This will be your visa photograph, which you will later upload and submit with your online visa application.
The US visas website offers specific instructions on how to take and upload a visa photograph, as well as examples of acceptable and unacceptable photographs. Be aware that as of November 2016, glasses are no longer allowed in visa photographs.
 
Finally, you’ll need to have a decent sum of money on hand so that you can pay the various visa-related fees. We’ll discuss in more detail what these fees are and how to pay them later. But as a brief overview, here are the required fees for a US student visa:
 

 
Now that you understand the basic items you’ll need to have ready, let’s walk through how to apply for a student visa, one step at a time.
NOTE: The application process for an F-1 visa is identical to that for an M-1 visa and similar to that for a J-1 visa. As a result, the visa process described below may be used for all three types of US student visas. If you have any questions about your visa type or how to apply for one, consult the US visas website.
 
The first step is to apply (and eventually gain admission) to a US school. Most full-time undergraduate and graduate programs in the US require applications to be submitted by December or January each year. Schools typically send out admission notifications around March and April.
As I mentioned previously, the schools you apply to must be approved by SEVP. To find an SEVP-approved school or to confirm that the schools you've chosen are in fact certified by SEVP, use the SEVP school search tool.
J-1 students will most likely apply for exchange programs through their home institutions. You may also look for designated sponsor organizations online at the official J-1 visa website.
 


 
Once admitted to a school, you'll receive one of two forms: F-1 and M-1 students will receive Form I-20 (Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status), and J-1 students will receive Form DS-2019 (Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status).
Your school will mail the appropriate form to you. On your form will be your SEVIS ID, your school’s address, and other critical information concerning your program. You will need this form for your visa interview (we explain the interview process more in step 8) and to pay certain fees (which we discuss next in step 3).
 
Once you receive your I-20 or DS-2019 form from your school, go online and pay the I-901 SEVIS fee. Once again, this fee is 350 USD for F-1/M-1 students and 220 USD for J-1 students. (Those participating in short-term J-1 visa programs will pay only 35 USD.)
Most students (except those from Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, or Nigeria) can pay this fee online by credit card. Note that the I-901 SEVIS fee is separate from your visa application fee (which we explain more in step 7).
Once you've paid this fee, print out your confirmation page, as you’ll need to bring it to your visa interview.
 
You must apply for your international student visa through your nearest US embassy or consulate (ideally, in the city or region in which you live). You can search for US embassies and consulates online through the US Department of State.
Be aware that US student visa processes may differ slightly depending on the embassy through which you apply. This means that at some embassies, you may need to submit additional documentation with your visa application. For more details on what you'll need to submit, go to your embassy’s official website or contact your embassy directly.

Next, complete the Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application, also known as Form DS-160. To successfully fill out this form, be sure you have the following items on hand:
In addition, you may need to supply:
On this application, you will also select the US embassy at which you intend to interview for your visa.
Note that you must fill out the entire form in English, except when asked to input your full name in your native alphabet. Translations are available on the form for those who have difficulty understanding the English instructions. If you have any additional questions about how to fill out this form, go to the official DS-160 FAQ page.
Once you've completed this form and submitted it online, print out your confirmation page to bring to your visa interview.
 
After you've submitted Form DS-160, contact your nearest US embassy or consulate (ideally, the one you input on your online application) to schedule your visa interview.
Wait times for interviews vary depending on the embassy. Go to the US visas website to see the wait times for your embassy.
 
Next, pay the 160 USD application fee. This fee is the same price regardless of your country of origin and where you apply.
Note that when you pay this fee will vary depending on your embassy. Although many embassies require applicants to pay the application fee before their interviews, not all do. Your embassy should instruct you as to when and how you'll need to pay your visa application fee. If your embassy requires you to pay this fee before your interview, be sure to bring your receipt as proof of payment to your interview.
 

 
The last big step in the visa process is the interview. This interview will be the deciding factor as to whether you will receive a US student visa or not.
Before attending your interview, gather the following items and information:
Your particular embassy may require additional forms and documentation, such as:
You will undergo a security check and provide digital, ink-free fingerprints, usually right after you arrive at your interview.
During the interview, you will be asked a range of questions in English. These questions will mostly focus on why you want to study at the school you've selected and what you intend to do after the program finishes. It is important to clearly state that you do not intend to remain in the US once you complete your program. Websites such as International Student and Happy Schools offer extensive lists of sample questions you may be asked during your interview.
If your interview is successful, your embassy will then inform you when and how it will return your passport (with your new visa) to you. (To get your visa, you must leave your passport with your embassy.)
 
Some students must pay a visa issuance fee once they have been approved for a US student visa. Whether this fee is required or not depends on your nationality and your country’s reciprocity agreement with the US. The US visas website offers a chart you can use to see whether you must pay a visa issuance fee.
 
Once you’ve completed all of the steps above and have received approval for an international student visa to the US, your embassy will return your passport to you with your new visa in it. Note that some embassies will require you to come in person to pick it up, whereas others will mail it directly back to you.
Visa processing times will vary depending on your embassy. You can get an estimate as to how long your visa will take to process by going to the US visas website.
 

 
According to the US visas website, most applications for US visas are approved. That said, in rare cases, you may be denied an international student visa. This typically only happens when you fail to fulfill a certain requirement before or during your interview.
Here are some examples of problems likely to make you ineligible for a US student visa:
This list highlights some of the many reasons international students are denied US visas. If your application for a student visa is rejected, your embassy will tell you why. Unfortunately, you cannot get your money back in the case of a rejection. Moreover, embassies will not reevaluate visa applications, so if you are rejected, you must repeat the process above in order to reapply for a student visa.
In the end, visa rejections are not common. As long as you do everything you need to do and follow the steps we've given you, you should have no problem obtaining a US student visa!
 
You now know how to get a student visa — but how can you make sure you won't face any problems along the way? Follow our three tips below to ensure that your visa application process proceeds without hassle.
 
Applying for your visa with too little time before your program starts will most likely result in a visa rejection, so try to apply for a student visa as soon as you are accepted and have received Form I-20 or Form DS-2019 from your school.
If you are applying to multiple US schools, I recommend waiting to apply for a visa until you have received admission notifications from all of your schools, or until you have received an acceptance to your top-choice school. Doing this allows you to weigh your options and choose the best school for you.
 

 
Although it’s a good idea to start the student visa application process early, it's best not to buy any plane tickets until after you've received your visa since there's no guarantee that your application will be approved.
If you purchase a plane ticket ahead of time and are then rejected for a US student visa, you will most likely not receive a full refund for your airfare. (Refund policies vary depending on the airline, but usually you cannot get a full refund if you cancel more than 24 hours after booking a flight.)
 
The visa application process described above is the general process for securing an F-1, M-1, or J-1 international student visa to the US. That said, you may find that your visa process differs slightly from the steps described above. Usually, this is due to differences in how US embassies choose to handle or process certain information.
As a result, always direct any questions or concerns you have about the visa process to your closest embassy. Your embassy is hands down the best resource for questions about fees, the interview, and other visa-related matters.
 
If you want clarification or extra guidance on certain aspects of the US visa application process, here are a few official resources we recommend using:
 

 
All international students who want to study in the US must first obtain an international student visa. The three main visa types for international students are the F-1 visa, the M-1 visa, and the J-1 visa. Students who intend to study full-time in a US undergraduate or graduate program will most likely apply for an F-1 visa.
Before you begin your visa application, you'll need to have a passport that's valid for at least six months beyond your program end date, a digital copy of a passport-style photograph, and money for application fees.
Our 10-step guide above explains how to apply for a student visa to the US. To reiterate, here are the steps you'll need to take:

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

A consular officer will interview you to determine whether you are qualified to receive a student visa. You must establish that you meet the requirements under U.S. law to receive a visa.
Ink-free, digital fingerprint scans are taken as part of the application process. They are usually taken during your interview, but this varies based on location.
After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing.  The consular officer will inform you if this is required.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.
While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa.  However, once you depart the United States you must apply for a new visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.

There is no guarantee you will be issued a visa. Do not make final travel plans or buy tickets until you have a visa.
For information about working in the United States during your study, review Students and Employment and Form I-765 Work Authorization Instructions on the USCIS website.
If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.

Any changes to the information that appears on your I-20 or DS-2019 must be up-to-date. This information includes:
If any of the above changes, please request an update to your I-20/ DS-2019 through the OISS Portal.
Understanding your Immigration Document provides additional information about your immigration document.
Report any financial support/funding changes, such as a change from scholarship funds to family funding. Contact your OISS Advisor if you need to update your financial information.  
Report changes such as name, dependent name, or immigration status:
Federal immigration regulations require nonimmigrant students in F-1 or J-1 status to be enrolled in a full-time course load each term to maintain nonimmigrant visa status. Students who are not enrolled full time by the end of each add/drop period or who drop below full-time without approval by the OISS violate their student immigration status.
OISS is committed to working closely with NU schools, departments, students, and the Office of the Registrar to ensure all students are enrolled in a full course load each term.
Full-time enrollment is required in the summer term only if it is a student's first or last term of enrollment.
Students must be physically present on Northwestern's campus during every quarter of enrollment unless otherwise approved for study or research abroad.
OISS is required to report in the Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) whether a student is enrolled full-time at Northwestern University, received an authorized reduced course load, dropped below a full course of study without prior authorization by a Designated School Official (OISS Advisor), or failed to enroll.
Failure to meet the full-time enrollment requirement without an approved authorized reduced course load may result in your SEVIS record being terminated.
 
 
For both graduate and undergraduate F-1 and J-1 students, only one unit or 1 credit of online/remote course may count toward the full-time enrollment requirement. The one unit/credit limit is for every academic term when students are expected to be enrolled full-time.  
If F-1 or J-1 students enroll in more than their minimum unit requirement, they MAY enroll in more than one unit of online/remote courses.
Hybrid courses with required on-campus components do not count towards this limitation.
Students on an approved reduced course load (see below) cannot be enrolled in only online/remote coursework.
On-campus presence refers to the regulatory requirement for international students in F-1 or J-1 status to enroll in coursework that ""requires the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to the completion of the class."" Students must register for a certain number of credit hours that are taught using an instruction mode that requires in-person attendance. Students must be physically present on campus during every quarter of enrollment unless otherwise approved for study or research abroad.
Under certain circumstances, F-1 students may receive approval from OISS to enroll in a reduced course load and maintain their student status.
If you need a reduced course load for medical reasons or academic difficulties, talk with your OISS Advisor as soon as possible. You cannot drop below a full course of study unless your OISS Advisor approves the reduced course load and updates your student record in SEVIS.
More information about exceptions to the full-time enrollment requirement
Students cannot be enrolled in only online coursework, even if approved for a reduced course load by OISS. See below for more information on reduced course load (RCL).
 
 
In certain situations, students may be authorized for less than full-time enrollment for specific academic reasons.   
A reduced course load for specific academic reasons requires recommendation of student’s academic or major advisor. There are three types of academic reduced course loads available to international students:  
Students cannot be enrolled in only online coursework, even if approved for a reduced course load by OISS. 
If you qualify for Reduced Course Load, please submit your request at the OISS Portal. If you request a reduced course load for academic difficulties or concurrent enrollment, please email or schedule an appointment with your OISS Advisor.  
Students may apply for RCL due to a medical condition documented by a licensed medical doctor (MD), doctor of osteopathy (DO), psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or clinical psychologist. Please note:  
If you qualify for Reduced Course Load, please submit your request at the OISS Portal. 
Federal regulations limit F-1 and J-1 student employment options.
You my not work off-campus without prior approval and authorization from OISS.
To attain authorization, please review our student employment information and then meet with an advisor if you have questions.
U.S. federal immigration regulations require all international students to maintain a permanent foreign address and current U.S. address. These are maintained as your Permanent (non-U.S. address) and Current (U.S. address) Address in CAESAR, and these are automatically reported to SEVIS.
Failure to correctly maintain these addresses may result in a delay in processing any requests.
All NU students are required to maintain accurate emergency information in their CAESAR account, which includes listing your emergency contacts phone number and address.
How to update your emergency contact in CAESAR
International students in F-1 or J-1 status may travel within the U.S. or abroad during their tenure at Northwestern, but they must follow certain travel restrictions.

While studying in the United States, it is important to maintain your F or M student status. Your status relates to the purpose, or reason for why you want to come to the United States. The U.S. Department of State issues you your visa based on your intended purpose. 
If the Department of State issues you an F or M student visa, this means that you are coming to the United States to study. You should not take any action that detracts from that purpose. Maintaining your status means:
Fulfilling the purpose for why the Department of State issued you your visa.
Following the regulations associated with that purpose.
F-1 and M-1 students share the same primary purpose for coming to the United States however, F-1 students enroll in more traditional academic programs, while M-1 students enroll in vocational programs. Because these two types of programs are different in nature, the types of benefits an international student may be eligible for and how long they may remain in the country depend on whether they are an F-1 or M-1 student.  Learn more about these specific differences by reviewing the F&M Student Status: Know the Difference infographic.
Below are actions to take in order to properly maintain your status.
When arriving to the United States, both F and M students must:
Enter the United States no more than 30 days before your program of study begins.
Immediately contact your designated school official (DSO) when you enter the United States.
When you arrive at school, you need to contact your DSO again, no later than the program start date listed on your Form I-20, ""Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.""
While studying in the United States, both F and M students must:
F-1 students must complete at least one full academic year at an SEVP-certified school to be eligible for annual vacation. Additionally, students must intend to register for classes in the academic term following their annual vacation.
SEVP-certified schools should have clear and consistent policies regarding annual vacation and comply with the requirements laid out in SEVP Policy Guidance for Adjudicators 1408-01: Academic Year.
Please note that during an annual vacation, students can take as many, as few or no courses as they want. SEVP considers all study during an annual vacation incident to status.
An F student may only work when authorized by a DSO in some cases, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in others. If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately, and you may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date. 
F students are also eligible for optional practical training during or following the program of study. OPT is a form of temporary employment that directly relates to your program of study. 
For more information about employment and training options available for F-students, visit the Working in the United States page and talk with your DSO.
M-1 students are not eligible for employment during their program of study, but may obtain authorization for practical training employment. You may participate in practical training employment after the completion of your vocational program. 
If you want to participate in practical training employment in the United States, talk with your DSO about your options. Practical training employment requires your DSO’s recommendation and authorization from USCIS. 
If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately. You may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date.
F and M students must take action to maintain legal status or depart the United States after completing your program of study.
Once you complete your program of study and any authorized period of practical training, F students have 60 days after completion of your program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. If you wish to extend your stay in the United States, talk with your DSO to learn more about doing one of the following:
Transfer to another school.
Change your education level (e.g. bachelor’s to master’s).
Apply to change status  to another visa status (e.g. H-1B-temporary worker; O-extraordinary ability in science, art or business; P-athlete).
M students have 30 days after completion of their program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. The latest date you may remain in the United States is the “admit until” date on your Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record,” unless you filed for an extension with USCIS.
If you are an F or M student studying in the United States, your DSO should be the first person you talk with if you have any questions regarding the legal requirements of your stay in the United States. Your DSO can assist in answering your questions or help you find someone who can help.
M-1 students should speak with their DSO if they are planning to do any of the following:
Take a break from school.
Travel outside the United States.
Move to a new address.
Request a program extension.
Both F and M students may contact SEVP by email at sevp@ice.dhs.gov if your DSO is unable to assist you or if you would prefer to ask someone else.
In your email, please describe your situation and include any questions you have. SEVP provides responses on a first-come, first-served basis. Answer times may vary depending on the current number of inquiries.

Understanding student visa regulations: A step-by-step guide,"by Corinne Dorsey | In 
				
					Guides and Tools, Visa and Immigration Tips | 26 December 2023
| Updated on: December 26th, 2023 
To study in a foreign country, international students need a visa. This  allows them to not only enter the country but to  stay for a specific period of time to study. That’s why it’s important to know how to navigate country-specific visa regulations.
This step-by-step guide provides detailed information on the steps required for visa applications.
Start by researching the specific student visa regulations of your intended destination country. Visit the official website of the country’s embassy or consulate to access the most recent and accurate information. Understand the various visa categories, application procedures and eligibility requirements that apply to international students.
Ensure the courses and college or university you select are recognized and accredited. Research universities and colleges thoroughly, considering factors such as academic reputation, available scholarships  and alumni success stories. This research will not only enhance your educational experience but also contribute significantly to your visa application’s credibility.
Here’s a list of documents you may be required to submit for your visa application:
Guidelines can change, so stay up to date on any additional immigration documents or requirements.
Many countries require international students to prove they’ll have sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses and health care. Stay informed about the specific financial requirements of your destination country and plan your finances accordingly. Investigate scholarship opportunities and financial aid options to ease the financial burden. 
MPOWER Financing offers a loan program tailored to the needs of international students, including loans for tuition, housing and living expenses when studying in the U.S. 
Some countries mandate health insurance coverage for international students during their stay, especially while in university. Additionally, a medical examination might be necessary to meet the host country’s health standards. Secure comprehensive health insurance and schedule the required medical checkups well in advance.
Fill out the visa application form accurately and thoroughly. Pay attention to every detail, as any errors or incomplete information could lead to delays in processing your application. Stay updated on the visa processing times and guidelines provided by the embassy or consulate.
Certain countries conduct visa interviews to assess applicants’ intentions and eligibility. Practice common interview questions related to your study plans, financial status and ties to your home country. Approach the interview with confidence and honesty, as immigration officers appreciate genuine and straightforward responses.
Once you obtain the student visa, familiarize yourself with the regulations governing your stay. Stay updated on visa renewal procedures, work limitations and any other legal obligations. Compliance with these regulations is essential for maintaining your legal status and ensuring a smooth academic journey.
If you plan to study in the U.S., it’s crucial to grasp the complexities of the entry process. Having a visa doesn’t guarantee entry; it merely grants access to a U.S. port of entry, where U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials decide on admission.
Upon arrival, a CBP official will inspect your passport, visa and Form I-20. If granted admission, you receive an admission stamp or Form I-94. Learn about arrival procedures for students on the CBP website, including entry requirements and restrictions on items such as food and agricultural products.
Students on F visas have a 60-day window after the program end date (as listed on Form I-20) to depart, unless authorized for practical training. Extensions can be requested through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website. Failing to leave on time puts you out of status and voids your visa, which can lead to a permanent bar in the U.S.
If your plans change (e.g., marriage to a U.S. citizen), a status change is possible through USCIS. While in the U.S., a change doesn’t necessitate a new visa. However, for re-entry, acquiring a new visa is essential.
The regulations needed to obtain a visa might seem overwhelming, but by following this comprehensive step-by-step guide, you’re well on your way to securing your visa successfully. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. For further assistance, watch our  Visa 101 video featuring an immigration expert to help address any lingering questions you might have during your visa application process.

(3) General requirements. (i) Every nonimmigrant alien who applies for admission to, or an extension of stay in, the United States, must establish that he or she is admissible to the United States, or that any ground of inadmissibility has been waived under section 212(d)(3) of the Act. Upon application for admission, the alien must present a valid passport and valid visa unless either or both documents have been waived. A nonimmigrant alien's admission to the United States is conditioned on compliance with any inspection requirement in §235.1(d) or of this chapter. The passport of an alien applying for admission must be valid for a minimum of six months from the expiration date of the contemplated period of stay, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, and the alien must agree to abide by the terms and conditions of his or her admission. An alien applying for extension of stay must present a passport only if requested to do so by the Department of Homeland Security. The passport of an alien applying for extension of stay must be valid at the time of application for extension, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, and the alien must agree to maintain the validity of his or her passport and to abide by all the terms and conditions of his extension.
(ii) At the time of admission or extension of stay, every nonimmigrant alien must also agree to depart the United States at the expiration of his or her authorized period of admission or extension of stay, or upon abandonment of his or her authorized nonimmigrant status, and to comply with the departure procedures at section 215.8 of this chapter if such procedures apply to the particular alien. The nonimmigrant alien's failure to comply with those departure requirements, including any requirement that the alien provide biometric identifiers, may constitute a failure of the alien to maintain the terms of his or her nonimmigrant status.
(iii) At the time a nonimmigrant alien applies for admission or extension of stay, he or she must post a bond on Form I-352 in the sum of not less than $500, to ensure the maintenance of his or her nonimmigrant status and departure from the United States, if required to do so by the Commissioner of CBP, the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an immigration judge, or the Board of Immigration Appeals.
(b) Readmission of nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15) (F), (J), (M), or (Q)(ii) to complete unexpired periods of previous admission or extension of stay—(1) Section 101(a)(15)(F). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for duration of status as defined in §214.2(f)(5)(iii), any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(F) of the Act, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United States not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory or adjacent islands;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the requirement for presentation of a passport; and
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, an Arrival-Departure Record, Form I-94 (see §1.4), issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay, the alien's Form I-20 ID copy, and either:
(A) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20A-B if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20A since the form was initially issued; or
(B) A new Form I-20A-B if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20A since the form was initially issued.
(2) Section 101(a)(15)(J). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's departure, any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United States not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory or adjacent islands;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the requirement for the presentation of a passport; and
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, Form I-94 issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay or copy three of the last Form IAP-66 issued to the alien. Form I-94 or Form IAP-66 must show the unexpired period of the alien's stay endorsed by the Service.
(3) Section 101(a)(15)(M). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's departure, any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(M) of the Act, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the requirement for presentation of a passport; and
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, Form I-94 issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay, the alien's Form I-20 ID copy, and a properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N.
(4) Section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii). The inspecting immigration officer shall readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's departure, if the alien:
(i) Is admissible;
(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United States not exceeding 30 days solely in contiguous territory or adjacent islands;
(iii) Is in possession of a valid passport;
(iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien who presents, an Arrival-Departure Record, Form I-94, issued to the alien in connection with the previous admission or stay. The principal alien must also present a Certification Letter issued by the Department of State's Program Administrator.
(c) Extensions of stay—(1) Filing on Form I-129. An employer seeking the services of an E-1, E-2, H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, H-3, L-1, O-1, O-2, P-1, P-2, P-3, Q-1, R-1, or TN nonimmigrant beyond the period previously granted, must petition for an extension of stay on Form I-129. The petition must be filed with the fee required in §103.7 of this chapter, and the initial evidence specified in §214.2, and on the petition form. Dependents holding derivative status may be included in the petition if it is for only one worker and the form version specifically provides for their inclusion. In all other cases dependents of the worker should file on Form I-539.
(2) Filing on Form I-539. Any other nonimmigrant alien, except an alien in F or J status who has been granted duration of status, who seeks to extend his or her stay beyond the currently authorized period of admission, must apply for an extension of stay on Form I-539 with the fee required in §103.7 of this chapter together with any initial evidence specified in the applicable provisions of §214.2, and on the application form. More than one person may be included in an application where the co-applicants are all members of a single family group and either all hold the same nonimmigrant status or one holds a nonimmigrant status and the other co-applicants are his or her spouse and/or children who hold derivative nonimmigrant status based on his or her status. Extensions granted to members of a family group must be for the same period of time. The shortest period granted to any member of the family shall be granted to all members of the family. In order to be eligible for an extension of stay, nonimmigrant aliens in K-3/K-4 status must do so in accordance with §214.2(k)(10).
(3) Ineligible for extension of stay. A nonimmigrant in any of the following classes is ineligible for an extension of stay:
(i) B-1 or B-2 where admission was pursuant to the Visa Waiver Pilot Program;
(ii) C-1, C-2, C-3;
(iii) D-1, D-2;
(iv) K-1, K-2;
(v) Any nonimmigrant admitted for duration of status, other than as provided in §214.2(f)(7);
(vi) Any nonimmigrant who is classified pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act beyond a total of 3 years; or
(vii) Any nonimmigrant who is classified according to section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii) of the Act beyond a total of 3 years.
(viii) Any nonimmigrant admitted pursuant to the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program, as provided in section 212(l) of the Act.
(4) Timely filing and maintenance of status. An extension of stay may not be approved for an applicant who failed to maintain the previously accorded status or where such status expired before the application or petition was filed, except that failure to file before the period of previously authorized status expired may be excused in the discretion of the Service and without separate application, with any extension granted from the date the previously authorized stay expired, where it is demonstrated at the time of filing that:
(i) The delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the applicant or petitioner, and the Service finds the delay commensurate with the circumstances;
(ii) The alien has not otherwise violated his or her nonimmigrant status;
(iii) The alien remains a bona fide nonimmigrant; and
(iv) The alien is not the subject of deportation proceedings under section 242 of the Act (prior to April 1, 1997) or removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act.
(5) Decision in Form I-129 or I-539 extension proceedings. Where an applicant or petitioner demonstrates eligibility for a requested extension, it may be granted at the discretion of the Service. There is no appeal from the denial of an application for extension of stay filed on Form I-129 or I-539.
(d) Termination of status. Within the period of initial admission or extension of stay, the nonimmigrant status of an alien shall be terminated by the revocation of a waiver authorized on his or her behalf under section 212(d) (3) or (4) of the Act; by the introduction of a private bill to confer permanent resident status on such alien; or, pursuant to notification in the Federal Register, on the basis of national security, diplomatic, or public safety reasons.
(e) Employment. A nonimmigrant in the United States in a class defined in section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Act as a temporary visitor for pleasure, or section 101(a)(15)(C) of the Act as an alien in transit through this country, may not engage in any employment. Any other nonimmigrant in the United States may not engage in any employment unless he has been accorded a nonimmigrant classification which authorizes employment or he has been granted permission to engage in employment in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. A nonimmigrant who is permitted to engage in employment may engage only in such employment as has been authorized. Any unauthorized employment by a nonimmigrant constitutes a failure to maintain status within the meaning of section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
(f) Registration and false information. A nonimmigrant's admission and continued stay in the United States is conditioned on compliance with any registration, photographing, and fingerprinting requirements under §264.1(f) of this chapter that relate to the maintenance of nonimmigrant status and also on the full and truthful disclosure of all information requested by the Service. Willful failure by a nonimmigrant to register or to provide full and truthful information requested by the Service (regardless of whether or not the information requested was material) constitutes a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status under section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)).
(g) Criminal activity. A condition of a nonimmigrant's admission and continued stay in the United States is obedience to all laws of United States jurisdictions which prohibit the commission of crimes of violence and for which a sentence of more than one year imprisonment may be imposed. A nonimmigrant's conviction in a jurisdiction in the United States for a crime of violence for which a sentence of more than one year imprisonment may be imposed (regardless of whether such sentence is in fact imposed) constitutes a failure to maintain status under section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
(h) Education privacy and F, J, and M nonimmigrants. As authorized by section 641(c)(2) of Division C of Pub. L. 104-208, 8 U.S.C. 1372, and §2.1(a) of this chapter, the Service has determined that, with respect to F and M nonimmigrant students and J nonimmigrant exchange visitors, waiving the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. 1232g, is necessary for the proper implementation of 8 U.S.C. 1372. An educational agency or institution may not refuse to report information concerning an F or M nonimmigrant student or a J nonimmigrant exchange visitor that the educational agency or institution is required to report under 8 U.S.C. 1372 and §214.3(g) (or any corresponding Department of State regulation concerning J nonimmigrants) on the basis of FERPA and any regulation implementing FERPA. The waiver of FERPA under this paragraph authorizes and requires an educational agency or institution to report information concerning an F, J or M nonimmigrant that would ordinarily be protected by FERPA, but only to the extent that 8 U.S.C. 1372 and §214.3(g) (or any corresponding Department of State regulation concerning J nonimmigrants) requires the educational agency or institution to report information.
(i) Employment in a health care occupation. (1) Except as provided in 8 CFR 212.15(n), any alien described in 8 CFR 212.15(a) who is coming to the United States to perform labor in a health care occupation described in 8 CFR 212.15(c) must obtain a certificate from a credentialing organization described in 8 CFR 212.15(e). The certificate or certified statement must be presented to the Department of Homeland Security in accordance with 8 CFR 212.15(d). In the alternative, an eligible alien seeking admission as a nurse may obtain a certified statement as provided in 8 CFR 212.15(h).
(2) A TN nonimmigrant may establish that he or she is eligible for a waiver described at 8 CFR 212.15(n) by providing evidence that his or her initial admission as a TN (or TC) nonimmigrant health care worker occurred before September 23, 2003, and he or she was licensed and employed in the United States as a health care worker before September 23, 2003. Evidence may include, but is not limited to, copies of TN or TC approval notices, copies of Form I-94 Arrival/Departure Records, employment verification letters and/or pay-stubs or other employment records, and state health care worker licenses.
(j) Extension of stay or change of status for health care worker. In the case of any alien admitted temporarily as a nonimmigrant under section 212(d)(3) of the Act and 8 CFR 212.15(n) for the primary purpose of the providing labor in a health care occupation described in 8 CFR 212.15(c), the petitioning employer may file a Form I-129 to extend the approval period for the alien's classification for the nonimmigrant status. If the alien is in the United States and is eligible for an extension of stay or change of status, the Form I-129 also serves as an application to extend the period of the alien's authorized stay or to change the alien's status. Although the Form I-129 petition may be approved, as it relates to the employer's request to classify the alien, the application for an extension of stay or change of status shall be denied if:
(1) The petitioner or applicant fails to submit the certification required by 8 CFR 212.15(a) with the petition or application to extend the alien's stay or change the alien's status; or
(2) The petition or application to extend the alien's stay or change the alien's status does include the certification required by 8 CFR 212.15(a), but the alien obtained the certification more than 1 year after the date of the alien's admission under section 212(d)(3) of the Act and 8 CFR 212.15(n). While DHS may admit, extend the period of authorized stay, or change the status of a nonimmigrant health care worker for a period of 1 year if the alien does not have certification on or before July 26, 2004 (or on or before July 26, 2005, in the case of a citizen of Canada or Mexico, who, before September 23, 2003, was employed as a TN or TC nonimmigrant health care worker and held a valid license from a U.S. jurisdiction), the alien will not be eligible for a subsequent admission, change of status, or extension of stay as a health care worker if the alien has not obtained the requisite certification 1 year after the initial date of admission, change of status, or extension of stay as a health care worker.
(k) Denial of petitions under section 214(c) of the Act based on a finding by the Department of Labor. Upon debarment by the Department of Labor pursuant to 20 CFR part 655, USCIS may deny any petition filed by that petitioner for nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(H) (except for status under sections 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1)), (L), (O), and (P)(i) of the Act) for a period of at least 1 year but not more than 5 years. The length of the period shall be based on the severity of the violation or violations. The decision to deny petitions, the time period for the bar to petitions, and the reasons for the time period will be explained in a written notice to the petitioner.

(ii) Disposition of Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID. Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID contains two copies, the I-20 School Copy and the I-20 ID (Student) Copy. For purposes of clarity, the entire Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID shall be referred to as Form I-20 A-B and the I-20 ID (Student) Copy shall be referred to as the I-20 ID. When an F-1 student applies for admission with a complete Form I-20 A-B, the inspecting officer shall:
(A) Transcribe the student's admission number from Form I-94 onto his or her Form I-20 A-B (for students seeking initial admission only);
(B) Endorse all copies of the Form I-20 A-B;
(C) Return the I-20 ID to the student; and
(D) Forward the I-20 School Copy to the Service's processing center for data entry. (The school copy of Form I-20 A-B will be sent back to the school as a notice of the student's admission after data entry.)
(iii) Use of SEVIS. On January 30, 2003, the use of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) will become mandatory for the issuance of any new Form I-20. A student or dependent who presents a non-SEVIS Form I-20 issued on or after January 30, 2003, will not be accepted for admission to the United States. Non-SEVIS Forms I-20 issued prior to January 30, 2003, will continue to be acceptable until August 1, 2003. However, schools must issue a SEVIS Form I-20 to any current student requiring a reportable action (e.g., extension of status, practical training, and requests for employment authorization) or a new Form I-20, or for any aliens who must obtain a new nonimmigrant student visa. As of August 1, 2003, the records of all current or continuing students must be entered in SEVIS.
(2) I-20 ID. An F-1 student is expected to safekeep the initial I-20 ID bearing the admission number and any subsequent copies which have been issued to him or her. Should the student lose his or her current I-20 ID, a replacement copy bearing the same information as the lost copy, including any endorsement for employment and notations, may be issued by the designated school official (DSO) as defined in 8 CFR 214.3(l)(1)(i).
(3) Admission of the spouse and minor children of an F-1 student. The spouse and minor children accompanying an F-1 student are eligible for admission in F-2 status if the student is admitted in F-1 status. The spouse and minor children following-to-join an F-1 student are eligible for admission to the United States in F-2 status if they are able to demonstrate that the F-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study, or engaged in approved practical training following completion of studies. In either case, at the time they seek admission, the eligible spouse and minor children of an F-1 student with a SEVIS Form I-20 must individually present an original SEVIS Form I-20 issued in the name of each F-2 dependent issued by a school authorized by the Service for attendance by F-1 foreign students. Prior to August 1, 2003, if exigent circumstances are demonstrated, the Service will allow the dependent of an F-1 student in possession of a SEVIS Form I-20 to enter the United States using a copy of the F-1 student's SEVIS Form I-20. (In the alternative, for dependents seeking admission to the United States prior to August 1, 2003, a copy of the F-1 student's current Form I-20ID issued prior to January 30, 2003, with proper endorsement by the DSO will satisfy this requirement.) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or Form I-20A-B) is required for a dependent where there has been any substantive change in the F-1 student's current information.
(4) Temporary absence. An F-1 student returning to the United States from a temporary absence of five months or less may be readmitted for attendance at a Service-approved educational institution, if the student presents:
(i) A current SEVIS Form I-20 (or, for readmission prior to August 1, 2003, a current Form I-20ID which was issued prior to January 30, 2003), properly endorsed by the DSO for reentry if there has been no substantive change to the most recent Form I-20 information; or
(ii) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or, for readmission prior to August 1, 2003, a new Form I-20ID which was issued prior to January 30, 2003), if there has been a substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20 information, such as in the case of a student who has changed the major area of study, who intends to transfer to another Service approved institution or who has advanced to a higher level of study.
(5) Duration of status—(i) General. Except for border commuter students covered by the provisions of paragraph (f)(18) of this section, an F-1 student is admitted for duration of status. Duration of status is defined as the time during which an F-1 student is pursuing a full course of study at an educational institution approved by the Service for attendance by foreign students, or engaging in authorized practical training following completion of studies, except that an F-1 student who is admitted to attend a public high school is restricted to an aggregate of 12 months of study at any public high school(s). An F-1 student may be admitted for a period up to 30 days before the indicated report date or program start date listed on Form I-20. The student is considered to be maintaining status if he or she is making normal progress toward completing a course of study.

(ii) Change in educational levels. An F-1 student who continues from one educational level to another is considered to be maintaining status, provided that the transition to the new educational level is accomplished according to transfer procedures outlined in paragraph (f)(8) of this section.
(iii) Annual vacation. An F-1 student at an academic institution is considered to be in status during the annual (or summer) vacation if the student is eligible and intends to register for the next term. A student attending a school on a quarter or trimester calendar who takes only one vacation a year during any one of the quarters or trimesters instead of during the summer is considered to be in status during that vacation, if the student has completed the equivalent of an academic year prior to taking the vacation.
(iv) Preparation for departure. An F-1 student who has completed a course of study and any authorized practical training following completion of studies will be allowed an additional 60-day period to prepare for departure from the United States or to transfer in accordance with paragraph (f)(8) of this section. An F-1 student authorized by the DSO to withdraw from classes will be allowed a 15-day period for departure from the United States. However, an F-1 student who fails to maintain a full course of study without the approval of the DSO or otherwise fails to maintain status is not eligible for an additional period for departure.
(v) Emergent circumstances as determined by the Commissioner. Where the Commissioner has suspended the applicability of any or all of the requirements for on-campus or off-campus employment authorization for specified students pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9)(i) or (f)(9)(ii) of this section by notice in the Federal Register, an affected student who needs to reduce his or her full course of study as a result of accepting employment authorized by such notice in the Federal Register will be considered to be in status during the authorized employment, subject to any other conditions specified in the notice, provided that, for the duration of the authorized employment, the student is registered for the number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term specified in the notice, which in no event shall be less than 6 semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term if the student is at the undergraduate level or less than 3 semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term if the student is at the graduate level, and is continuing to make progress toward completing the course of study.
(vi) Extension of duration of status and grant of employment authorization.
(A) The duration of status, and any employment authorization granted under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B) and (C), of an F-1 student who is the beneficiary of an H-1B petition and request for change of status shall be automatically extended until October 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1B visa is being requested where such petition:
(1) Has been timely filed; and
(2) States that the employment start date for the F-1 student is October 1 of the following fiscal year.
(B) The automatic extension of an F-1 student's duration of status and employment authorization under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section shall immediately terminate upon the rejection, denial, or revocation of the H-1B petition filed on such F-1 student's behalf.
(C) In order to obtain the automatic extension of stay and employment authorization under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, the F-1 student, according to 8 CFR part 248, must not have violated the terms or conditions of his or her nonimmigrant status.
(D) An automatic extension of an F-1 student's duration of status under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section also applies to the duration of status of any F-2 dependent aliens.

(6) Full course of study—(i) General. Successful completion of the full course of study must lead to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective. A course of study at an institution not approved for attendance by foreign students as provided in §214.3(a)(3) does not satisfy this requirement. A “full course of study” as required by section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act means:
(A) Postgraduate study or postdoctoral study at a college or university, or undergraduate or postgraduate study at a conservatory or religious seminary, certified by a DSO as a full course of study;
(B) Undergraduate study at a college or university, certified by a school official to consist of at least twelve semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter hour systems, where all undergraduate students who are enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or are considered full-time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the district director in the school approval process), except when the student needs a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term;
(C) Study in a postsecondary language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other non-vocational program at a school which confers upon its graduates recognized associate or other degrees or has established that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning which are either: (1) A school (or school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof; or (2) a school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; and which has been certified by a designated school official to consist of at least twelve clock hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by the district director in the school approval process;
(D) Study in any other language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other nonvocational training program, certified by a designated school official to consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or to consist of at least twenty-two clock hours a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of laboratory work; or
(E) Study in a curriculum at an approved private elementary or middle school or public or private academic high school which is certified by a designated school official to consist of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress toward graduation.
(F) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) and (f)(6)(i)(B) of this section, an alien who has been granted employment authorization pursuant to the terms of a document issued by the Commissioner under paragraphs (f)(9)(i) or (f)(9)(ii) of this section and published in the Federal Register shall be deemed to be engaged in a “full course of study” if he or she remains registered for no less than the number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term specified by the Commissioner in the notice for the validity period of such employment authorization.

(G) For F-1 students enrolled in classes for credit or classroom hours, no more than the equivalent of one class or three credits per session, term, semester, trimester, or quarter may be counted toward the full course of study requirement if the class is taken on-line or through distance education and does not require the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to completion of the class. An on-line or distance education course is a course that is offered principally through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing. If the F-1 student's course of study is in a language study program, no on-line or distance education classes may be considered to count toward a student's full course of study requirement.
(H) On-campus employment pursuant to the terms of a scholarship, fellowship, or assistantship is deemed to be part of the academic program of a student otherwise taking a full course of study.
(ii) Institution of higher learning. For purposes of this paragraph, a college or university is an institution of higher learning which awards recognized associate, bachelor's, master's, doctorate, or professional degrees. Schools which devote themselves exclusively or primarily to vocational, business, or language instruction are not included in the category of colleges or universities. Vocational or business schools which are classifiable as M-1 schools are provided for by regulations under 8 CFR 214.2(m).
(iii) Reduced course load. The designated school official may allow an F-1 student to engage in less than a full course of study as provided in this paragraph (f)(6)(iii). Except as otherwise noted, a reduced course load must consist of at least six semester or quarter hours, or half the clock hours required for a full course of study. A student who drops below a full course of study without the prior approval of the DSO will be considered out of status. On-campus employment pursuant to the terms of a scholarship, fellowship, or assistantship is deemed to be part of the academic program of a student otherwise taking a full course of study.
(A) Academic difficulties. The DSO may authorize a reduced course load on account of a student's initial difficulty with the English language or reading requirements, unfamiliarity with U.S. teaching methods, or improper course level placement. The student must resume a full course of study at the next available term, session, or semester, excluding a summer session, in order to maintain student status. A student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to academic difficulties is not eligible for a second authorization by the DSO due to academic difficulties while pursuing a course of study at that program level. A student authorized to drop below a full course of study for academic difficulties while pursuing a course of study at a particular program level may still be authorized for a reduced course load due to an illness medical condition as provided for in paragraph (B) of this section.
(B) Medical conditions. The DSO may authorize a reduced course load (or, if necessary, no course load) due to a student's temporary illness or medical condition for a period of time not to exceed an aggregate of 12 months while the student is pursuing a course of study at a particular program level. In order to authorize a reduced course load based upon a medical condition, the student must provide medical documentation from a licensed medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or licensed clinical psychologist, to the DSO to substantiate the illness or medical condition. The student must provide current medical documentation and the DSO must reauthorize the drop below full course of study each new term, session, or semester. A student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to illness or medical condition for an aggregate of 12 months may not be authorized by a DSO to reduce his or her course load on subsequent occasions while pursuing a course of study at the same program level. A student may be authorized to reduce course load for a reason of illness or medical condition on more than one occasion while pursuing a course of study, so long as the aggregate period of that authorization does not exceed 12 months.
(C) Completion of course of study. The DSO may authorize a reduced course load in the student's final term, semester, or session if fewer courses are needed to complete the course of study. If the student is not required to take any additional courses to satisfy the requirements for completion, but continues to be enrolled for administrative purposes, the student is considered to have completed the course of study and must take action to maintain status. Such action may include application for change of status or departure from the U.S.
(D) Reporting requirements for non-SEVIS schools. A DSO must report to the Service any student who is authorized to reduce his or her course load. Within 21 days of the authorization, the DSO must send a photocopy of the student's current Form I-20ID along with Form I-538 to Service's data processing center indicating the date and reason that the student was authorized to drop below full time status. Similarly, the DSO will report to the Service no more than 21 days after the student has resumed a full course of study by submitting a current copy of the students' Form I-20ID to the Service's data processing center indicating the date a full course of study was resumed and the new program end date with Form I-538, if applicable.
(E) SEVIS reporting requirements. In order for a student to be authorized to drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS prior to the student reducing his or her course load. The DSO must update SEVIS with the date, reason for authorization, and the start date of the next term or session. The DSO must also notify SEVIS within 21 days of the student's commencement of a full course of study. If an extension of the program end date is required due to the drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS by completing a new SEVIS Form I-20 with the new program end date in accordance with paragraph (f)(7) of this section.

(iv) Concurrent enrollment. An F-1 student may be enrolled in two different Service-approved schools at one time as long as the combined enrollment amounts to a full time course of study. In cases where a student is concurrently enrolled, the school from which the student will earn his or her degree or certification should issue the Form I-20, and conduct subsequent certifications and updates to the Form I-20. The DSO from this school is also responsible for all of the reporting requirements to the Service. In instances where a student is enrolled in programs with different full course of study requirements (e.g., clock hours vs. credit hours), the DSO is permitted to determine what constitutes a full time course of study.
(7) Extension of stay—(i) General. An F-1 student who is admitted for duration of status is not required to apply for extension of stay as long as the student is maintaining status and making normal progress toward completion of his or her educational objective. An F-1 student who is currently maintaining status and making normal progress toward completing his or her educational objective, but who is unable to complete his or her course of study by the program end date on the Form I-20, must apply prior to the program end date for a program extension pursuant to paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section.
(ii) Report date and program completion date on Form I-20. When determining the report date on the Form I-20, the DSO may choose a reasonable date to accommodate a student's need to be in attendance for required activities at the school prior to the actual start of classes. Such required activities may include, but are not limited to, research projects and orientation sessions. However, for purposes of employment, the DSO may not indicate a report date more than 30 days prior to the start of classes. When determining the program completion date on Form I-20, the DSO should make a reasonable estimate based upon the time an average student would need to complete a similar program in the same discipline.
(iii) Program extension for students in lawful status. An F-1 student who is unable to meet the program completion date on the Form I-20 may be granted an extension by the DSO if the DSO certifies that the student has continually maintained status and that the delays are caused by compelling academic or medical reasons, such as changes of major or research topics, unexpected research problems, or documented illnesses. Delays caused by academic probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program extensions. A DSO may not grant an extension if the student did not apply for an extension until after the program end date noted on the Form I-20. An F-1 student who is unable to complete the educational program within the time listed on Form I-20 and who is ineligible for program extension pursuant to this paragraph (f)(7) is considered out of status. If eligible, the student may apply for reinstatement under the provisions of paragraph (f)(16) of this section.
(iv) Notification. Upon granting a program extension, a DSO at a non-SEVIS school must immediately submit notification to the Service's data processing center using Form I-538 and the top page of Form I-20A-B showing the new program completion date. For a school enrolled in SEVIS, a DSO may grant a program extension only by updating SEVIS and issuing a new Form I-20 reflecting the current program end date. A DSO may grant an extension any time prior to the program end date listed on the student's original Form I-20.

(8) School transfer. (i) A student who is maintaining status may transfer to another Service approved school by following the notification procedure prescribed in paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section. However, an F-1 student is not permitted to remain in the United States when transferring between schools or programs unless the student will begin classes at the transfer school or program within 5 months of transferring out of the current school or within 5 months of the program completion date on his or her current Form I-20, whichever is earlier. In the case of an F-1 student authorized to engage in post-completion optional practical training (OPT), the student must be able resume classes within 5 months of transferring out of the school that recommended OPT or the date the OPT authorization ends, whichever is earlier. An F-1 student who was not pursuing a full course of study at the school he or she was last authorized to attend is ineligible for school transfer and must apply for reinstatement under the provisions of paragraph (f)(16) of this section, or, in the alternative, may depart the country and return as an initial entry in a new F-1 nonimmigrant status.
(ii) Transfer procedure. To transfer schools, an F-1 student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a Form I-20 A-B, issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k), from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. The transfer will be effected only if the F-1 student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 A-B and returns the form to a designated school official on campus within 15 days of beginning attendance at the new school.
(A) Non-SEVIS School to Non-SEVIS school. To transfer from one non-SEVIS school to a different non-SEVIS school, the student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a Form I-20 issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k) from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Prior to issuance of any Form I-20, the DSO at the transfer school is responsible for determining that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school and is eligible for transfer to the new school. The transfer will be effected only if the student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 and returns the form to a DSO of the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on Form I-20. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 the DSO must note “transfer completed on (date)” in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance at the transfer school; return the Form I-20 to the student; submit the School copy of the Form I-20 to Service's Data Processing Center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and forward a photocopy of the school copy to the school from which the student transferred.
(B) Non-SEVIS school to SEVIS school. To transfer from a non-SEVIS school to a SEVIS school, the student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k) from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Prior to issuance of any Form I-20, the DSO at the transfer school is responsible for determining that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school and is eligible for transfer to the new school. Once the transfer school has issued the SEVIS Form I-20 to the student indicating a transfer, the transfer school becomes responsible for updating and maintaining the student's record in SEVIS. The student is then required to notify the DSO at the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on SEVIS Form I-20. Upon notification that the student is enrolled in classes, the DSO of the transfer school must update SEVIS to reflect the student's registration and current address, thereby acknowledging that the student has completed the transfer process. In the remarks section of the student's SEVIS Form I-20, the DSO must note that the transfer has been completed, including the date, and return the form to the student. The transfer is effected when the transfer school updates SEVIS indicating that the student has registered in classes within the 30 days required by §214.3(g)(3)(iii).
(C) SEVIS school to SEVIS school. To transfer from a SEVIS school to a SEVIS school the student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and must indicate the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school will update the student's record in SEVIS as a “transfer out” and indicate the school to which the student intends to transfer, and a release date. The release date will be the current semester or session completion date, or the date of expected transfer if earlier than the established academic cycle. The current school will retain control over the student's record in SEVIS until the student completes the current term or reaches the release date. At the request of the student, the DSO of the current school may cancel the transfer request at any time prior to the release date. As of the release date specified by the current DSO, the transfer school will be granted full access to the student's SEVIS record and then becomes responsible for that student. The current school conveys authority and responsibility over that student to the transfer school, and will no longer have full SEVIS access to that student's record. As such, a transfer request may not be cancelled by the current DSO after the release date has been reached. After the release date, the transfer DSO must complete the transfer of the student's record in SEVIS and may issue a SEVIS Form I-20. The student is then required to contact the DSO at the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on the SEVIS Form I-20. Upon notification that the student is enrolled in classes, the DSO of the transfer school must update SEVIS to reflect the student's registration and current address, thereby acknowledging that the student has completed the transfer process. In the remarks section of the student's SEVIS Form I-20, the DSO must note that the transfer has been completed, including the date, and return the form to the student. The transfer is effected when the transfer school notifies SEVIS that the student has enrolled in classes in accordance with the 30 days required by §214.3(g)(3)(iii).
(D) SEVIS school to non-SEVIS school. To transfer from a SEVIS school to a non-SEVIS school, the student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and must indicate the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school will update the student's status in SEVIS as “a transfer out”, enter a “release” or expected transfer date, and update the transfer school as “non-SEVIS.” The student must then notify the school to which the he or she intends to transfer of his or her intent to enroll. After the student has completed his or her current term or session, or has reached the expected transfer date, the DSO at the current school will no longer have full access to the student's SEVIS record. At this point, if the student has notified the transfer school of his or her intent to transfer, and the transfer school has determined that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school, the transfer school may issue the student a Form I-20. The transfer will be effected only if the student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 and returns the form to a designated school official of the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on Form I-20. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 the DSO must do as follows: note “transfer completed on (date)” in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance; return the Form I-20 to the student; submit the school copy of the Form I-20 to the Service's data processing center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and forward a photocopy of the school copy to the school from which the student transferred.
(iii) Notification. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 A-B, the DSO must:
(A) Note “transfer completed on (date)” on the student's I-20 ID in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance;
(B) Return the I-20 ID to the student;
(C) Submit the I-20 School copy to the Service's Data Processing Center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and
(D) Forward a photocopy of the Form I-20 A-B School Copy to the school from which the student transferred.
(9) Employment—(i) On-campus employment. On-campus employment must either be performed on the school's premises, (including on-location commercial firms which provide services for students on campus, such as the school bookstore or cafeteria), or at an off-campus location which is educationally affiliated with the school. Employment with on-site commercial firms, such as a construction company building a school building, which do not provide direct student services is not deemed on-campus employment for the purposes of this paragraph. In the case of off-campus locations, the educational affiliation must be associated with the school's established curriculum or related to contractually funded research projects at the post-graduate level. In any event, the employment must be an integral part of the student's educational program. Employment authorized under this paragraph must not exceed 20 hours a week while school is in session, unless the Commissioner suspends the applicability of this limitation due to emergent circumstances, as determined by the Commissioner, by means of notice in the Federal Register, the student demonstrates to the DSO that the employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship resulting from the emergent circumstances, and the DSO notates the Form I-20 in accordance with the Federal Register document. An F-1 student may, however, work on campus full-time when school is not in session or during the annual vacation. A student who has been issued a Form I-20 A-B to begin a new program in accordance with the provision of 8 CFR 214.3(k) and who intends to enroll for the next regular academic year, term, or session at the institution which issued the Form I-20 A-B may continue on-campus employment incident to status. Otherwise, an F-1 student may not engage in on-campus employment after completing a course of study, except employment for practical training as authorized under paragraph (f)(10) of this section. An F-I student may engage in any on-campus employment authorized under this paragraph which will not displace United States residents. In the case of a transfer in SEVIS, the student may only engage in on-campus employment at the school having jurisdiction over the student's SEVIS record. Upon initial entry to begin a new course of study, an F-1 student may not begin on-campus employment more than 30 days prior to the actual start of classes.
(ii) Off-campus work authorization—(A) General. An F-1 student may be authorized to work off-campus on a part-time basis in accordance with paragraph (f)(9)(ii) (B) or (C) of this section after having been in F-1 status for one full academic year provided that the student is in good academic standing as determined by the DSO. Part-time off-campus employment authorized under this section is limited to no more than twenty hours a week when school is in session. A student who is granted off-campus employment authorization may work full-time during holidays or school vacation. The employment authorization is automatically terminated whenever the student fails to maintain status. In emergent circumstances as determined by the Commissioner, the Commissioner may suspend the applicability of any or all of the requirements of paragraph (f)(9)(ii) of this section by notice in the Federal Register.
(B) [Reserved]
(C) Severe economic hardship. If other employment opportunities are not available or are otherwise insufficient, an eligible F-1 student may request off-campus employment work authorization based upon severe economic hardship caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the student's control. These circumstances may include loss of financial aid or on-campus employment without fault on the part of the student, substantial fluctuations in the value of currency or exchange rate, inordinate increases in tuition and/or living costs, unexpected changes in the financial condition of the student's source of support, medical bills, or other substantial and unexpected expenses.
(D) Procedure for off-campus employment authorization due to severe economic hardship. The student must request a recommendation from the DSO for off-campus employment. The DSO at a non-SEVIS school must make such a certification on Form I-538, Certification by Designated School Official. The DSO of a SEVIS school must complete such certification in SEVIS. The DSO may recommend the student for work off-campus for one year intervals by certifying that:
(1) The student has been in F-1 status for one full academic year;
(2) The student is in good standing as a student and is carrying a full course of study as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section;
(3) The student has demonstrated that acceptance of employment will not interfere with the student's carrying a full course of study; and
(4) The student has demonstrated that the employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the student's control pursuant to paragraph (f)(9)(ii)(C) of this section and has demonstrated that employment under paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section is unavailable or otherwise insufficient to meet the needs that have arisen as a result of the unforeseen circumstances.
(E) [Reserved]
(F) Severe economic hardship application. (1) The applicant should submit the economic hardship application for employment authorization on Form I-765, with the fee required by 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), to the service center having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. Applicants at a non-SEVIS school should submit Form I-20, Form I-538, and any other supporting materials such as affidavits which further detail the unforeseen circumstances that require the student to seek employment authorization and the unavailability or insufficiency of employment under paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section. Students enrolled in a SEVIS school should submit the SEVIS Form I-20 with the employment page demonstrating the DSO's comments and certification.
(2) The Service shall adjudicate the application for work authorization based upon severe economic hardship on the basis of Form I-20 ID, Form I-538, and Form I-765, and any additional supporting materials. If employment is authorized, the adjudicating officer shall issue an EAD. The Service director shall notify the student of the decision, and, if the application is denied, of the reason or reasons for the denial. No appeal shall lie from a decision to deny a request for employment authorization under this section. The employment authorization may be granted in one year intervals up to the expected date of completion of the student's current course of study. A student has permission to engage in off-campus employment only if the student receives the EAD endorsed to that effect. Off-campus employment authorization may be renewed by the Service only if the student is maintaining status and good academic standing. The employment authorization is automatically terminated whenever the student fails to maintain status.
(iii) Internship with an international organization. A bona fide F-1 student who has been offered employment by a recognized international organization within the meaning of the International Organization Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669) must apply for employment authorization to the service center having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. A student seeking employment authorization under this provision is required to present a written certification from the international organization that the proposed employment is within the scope of the organization's sponsorship, Form I-20 ID or SEVIS Form I-20 with employment page completed by DSO certifying eligibility for employment, and a completed Form I-765, with required fee as contained in §103.7(b)(1) of this chapter.
(10) Practical training. Practical training may be authorized to an F-1 student who has been lawfully enrolled on a full time basis, in a Service-approved college, university, conservatory, or seminary for one full academic year. This provision also includes students who, during their course of study, were enrolled in a study abroad program, if the student had spent at least one full academic term enrolled in a full course of study in the United States prior to studying abroad. A student may be authorized 12 months of practical training, and becomes eligible for another 12 months of practical training when he or she changes to a higher educational level. Students in English language training programs are ineligible for practical training. An eligible student may request employment authorization for practical training in a position that is directly related to his or her major area of study. There are two types of practical training available:
(i) Curricular practical training. An F-1 student may be authorized by the DSO to participate in a curricular practical training program that is an integral part of an established curriculum. Curricular practical training is defined to be alternative work/study, internship, cooperative education, or any other type of required internship or practicum that is offered by sponsoring employers through cooperative agreements with the school. Students who have received one year or more of full time curricular practical training are ineligible for post-completion academic training. Exceptions to the one academic year requirement are provided for students enrolled in graduate studies that require immediate participation in curricular practical training. A request for authorization for curricular practical training must be made to the DSO. A student may begin curricular practical training only after receiving his or her Form I-20 with the DSO endorsement.
(A) Non-SEVIS process. A student must request authorization for curricular practical training using Form I-538. Upon approving the request for authorization, the DSO shall: certify Form I-538 and send the form to the Service's data processing center; endorse the student's Form I-20 ID with “full-time (or part-time) curricular practical training authorized for (employer) at (location) from (date) to (date)”; and sign and date the Form I-20ID before returning it to the student.
(B) SEVIS process. To grant authorization for a student to engage in curricular practical training, a DSO at a SEVIS school will update the student's record in SEVIS as being authorized for curricular practical training that is directly related to the student's major area of study. The DSO will indicate whether the training is full-time or part-time, the employer and location, and the employment start and end date. The DSO will then print a copy of the employment page of the SEVIS Form I-20 indicating that curricular practical training has been approved. The DSO must sign, date, and return the SEVIS Form I-20 to the student prior to the student's commencement of employment.
(ii) Optional practical training.

(A) General. Consistent with the application and approval process in paragraph (f)(11) of this section, a student may apply to USCIS for authorization for temporary employment for optional practical training directly related to the student's major area of study. The student may not begin optional practical training until the date indicated on his or her employment authorization document, Form I-766. A student may be granted authorization to engage in temporary employment for optional practical training:
(1) During the student's annual vacation and at other times when school is not in session, if the student is currently enrolled, and is eligible for registration and intends to register for the next term or session;
(2) While school is in session, provided that practical training does not exceed 20 hours a week while school is in session; or
(3) After completion of the course of study, or, for a student in a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree program, after completion of all course requirements for the degree (excluding thesis or equivalent). Continued enrollment, for the school's administrative purposes, after all requirements for the degree have been met does not preclude eligibility for optional practical training. A student must complete all practical training within a 14-month period following the completion of study, except that a 24-month extension pursuant to paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section does not need to be completed within such 14-month period.
(B) Termination of practical training. Authorization to engage in optional practical training employment is automatically terminated when the student transfers to another school or begins study at another educational level.
(C) 24-month extension of post-completion OPT for a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) degree. Consistent with paragraph (f)(11)(i)(C) of this section, a qualified student may apply for an extension of OPT while in a valid period of post-completion OPT authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). An extension will be for 24 months for the first qualifying degree for which the student has completed all course requirements (excluding thesis or equivalent), including any qualifying degree as part of a dual degree program, subject to the requirement in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(3) of this section that previously obtained degrees must have been conferred. If a student completes all such course requirements for another qualifying degree at a higher degree level than the first, the student may apply for a second 24-month extension of OPT while in a valid period of post-completion OPT authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). In no event may a student be authorized for more than two lifetime STEM OPT extensions. A student who was granted a 17-month OPT extension under the rule issued at 73 FR 18944, whether or not such student requests an additional 7-month period of STEM OPT under 8 CFR 214.16, is considered to have been authorized for one STEM OPT extension, and may be eligible for only one more STEM OPT extension. Any subsequent application for an additional 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) must be based on a degree at a higher degree level than the degree that was the basis for the student's first OPT extension. In order to qualify for an extension of post-completion OPT based upon a STEM degree, all of the following requirements must be met.
(1) Accreditation. The degree that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension is from a U.S. educational institution accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education at the time of application.
(2) DHS-approved degree. The degree that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension is a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in a field determined by the Secretary, or his or her designee, to qualify within a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics field.
(i) The term “science, technology, engineering or mathematics field” means a field included in the Department of Education's Classification of Instructional Programs taxonomy within the two-digit series or successor series containing engineering, biological sciences, mathematics, and physical sciences, or a related field. In general, related fields will include fields involving research, innovation, or development of new technologies using engineering, mathematics, computer science, or natural sciences (including physical, biological, and agricultural sciences).
(ii) The Secretary, or his or her designee, will maintain the STEM Designated Degree Program List, which will be a complete list of qualifying degree program categories, published on the Student and Exchange Visitor Program Web site at http://www.ice.gov/sevis. Changes that are made to the Designated Degree Program List may also be published in a notice in the Federal Register. All program categories included on the list must be consistent with the definition set forth in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2)(i) of this section.
(iii) At the time the DSO recommends a 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) in SEVIS, the degree that is the basis for the application for the OPT extension must be contained within a category on the STEM Designated Degree Program List.
(3) Previously obtained STEM degree(s). The degree that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) may be, but is not required to be, the degree that is the basis for the post-completion OPT period authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). If an application for a 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) is based upon a degree obtained previous to the degree that provided the basis for the period of post-completion OPT authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B), that previously obtained degree must have been conferred from a U.S. educational institution that is accredited and SEVP-certified at the time the student's DSO recommends the student for the 24-month OPT extension and must be in a degree program category included on the current STEM Designated Degree Program List at the time of the DSO recommendation. That previously obtained degree must have been conferred within the 10 years preceding the date the DSO recommends the student for the 24-month OPT extension.
(4) Eligible practical training opportunity. The STEM practical training opportunity that is the basis for the 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) must be directly related to the degree that qualifies the student for such extension, which may be the previously obtained degree described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(3) of this section.
(5) Employer qualification. The student's employer is enrolled in E-Verify, as evidenced by either a valid E-Verify Company Identification number or, if the employer is using an employer agent to create its E-Verify cases, a valid E-Verify Client Company Identification number, and the employer remains a participant in good standing with E-Verify, as determined by USCIS. An employer must also have an employer identification number (EIN) used for tax purposes.
(6) Employer reporting. A student may not be authorized for employment with an employer pursuant to paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section unless the employer agrees, by signing the Training Plan for STEM OPT Students, Form I-983 or successor form, to report the termination or departure of an OPT student to the DSO at the student's school, if the termination or departure is prior to the end of the authorized period of OPT. Such reporting must be made within five business days of the termination or departure. An employer shall consider a student to have departed when the employer knows the student has left the practical training opportunity, or if the student has not reported for his or her practical training for a period of five consecutive business days without the consent of the employer, whichever occurs earlier.
(7) Training Plan for STEM OPT Students, Form I-983 or successor form. (i) A student must fully complete an individualized Form I-983 or successor form and obtain requisite signatures from an appropriate individual in the employer's organization on the form, consistent with form instructions, before the DSO may recommend a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section in SEVIS. A student must submit the Form I-983 or successor form, which includes a certification of adherence to the training plan completed by an appropriate individual in the employer's organization who has signatory authority for the employer, to the student's DSO, prior to the new DSO recommendation. A student must present his or her signed and completed Form I-983 or successor form to a DSO at the educational institution of his or her most recent enrollment. A student, while in F-1 student status, may also be required to submit the Form I-983 or successor form to ICE and/or USCIS upon request or in accordance with form instructions.
(ii) The training plan described in the Form I-983 or successor form must identify goals for the STEM practical training opportunity, including specific knowledge, skills, or techniques that will be imparted to the student, and explain how those goals will be achieved through the work-based learning opportunity with the employer; describe a performance evaluation process; and describe methods of oversight and supervision. Employers may rely on their otherwise existing training programs or policies to satisfy the requirements relating to performance evaluation and oversight and supervision, as applicable.
(iii) The training plan described in the Form I-983 or successor form must explain how the training is directly related to the student's qualifying STEM degree.
(iv) If a student initiates a new practical training opportunity with a new employer during his or her 24-month OPT extension, the student must submit, within 10 days of beginning the new practical training opportunity, a new Form I-983 or successor form to the student's DSO, and subsequently obtain a new DSO recommendation.
(8) Duties, hours, and compensation for training. The terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity during the period of the 24-month OPT extension, including duties, hours, and compensation, must be commensurate with terms and conditions applicable to the employer's similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment. A student may not engage in practical training for less than 20 hours per week, excluding time off taken consistent with leave-related policies applicable to the employer's similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment. If the employer does not employ and has not recently employed more than two similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment, the employer nevertheless remains obligated to attest that the terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity are commensurate with the terms and conditions of employment for other similarly situated U.S. workers in the area of employment. “Similarly situated U.S. workers” includes U.S. workers performing similar duties subject to similar supervision and with similar educational backgrounds, industry expertise, employment experience, levels of responsibility, and skill sets as the student. The duties, hours, and compensation of such students are “commensurate” with those offered to U.S. workers employed by the employer in the same area of employment when the employer can show that the duties, hours, and compensation are consistent with the range of such terms and conditions the employer has offered or would offer to similarly situated U.S. employees. The student must disclose his or her compensation, including any adjustments, as agreed to with the employer, on the Form I-983 or successor form.
(9) Evaluation requirements and Training Plan modifications. (i) A student may not be authorized for employment with an employer pursuant to paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section unless the student submits a self-evaluation of the student's progress toward the training goals described in the Form I-983 or successor form. All required evaluations must be completed prior to the conclusion of a STEM practical training opportunity, and the student and an appropriate individual in the employer's organization must sign each evaluation to attest to its accuracy. All STEM practical training opportunities require an initial evaluation within 12 months of the approved starting date on the employment authorization document granted pursuant to the student's 24-month OPT extension application, and a concluding evaluation. The student is responsible for ensuring the DSO receives his or her 12-month evaluation and final evaluation no later than 10 days following the conclusion of the reporting period or conclusion of his or her practical training opportunity, respectively.
(ii) If any material change to or deviation from the training plan described in the Form I-983 or successor form occurs, the student and employer must sign a modified Form I-983 or successor form reflecting the material change(s) or deviation(s). Material changes and deviations relating to training may include, but are not limited to, any change of Employer Identification Number resulting from a corporate restructuring, any reduction in compensation from the amount previously submitted on the Form I-983 or successor form that is not tied to a reduction in hours worked, any significant decrease in hours per week that a student engages in a STEM training opportunity, and any decrease in hours worked below the minimum hours for the 24-month extension as described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(8) of this section. Material changes and deviations also include any change or deviation that renders an employer attestation inaccurate, or renders inaccurate the information in the Form I-983 or successor form on the nature, purpose, oversight, or assessment of the student's practical training opportunity. The student and employer must ensure that the modified Form I-983 or successor form is submitted to the student's DSO at the earliest available opportunity.
(iii) The educational institution whose DSO is responsible for duties associated with the student's latest OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section is responsible for ensuring the Student and Exchange Visitor Program has access to each individualized Form I-983 or successor form and associated student evaluations (electronic or hard copy), including through SEVIS if technologically available, beginning within 30 days after the document is submitted to the DSO and continuing for a period of three years following the completion of each STEM practical training opportunity.
(10) Additional STEM opportunity obligations. A student may only participate in a STEM practical training opportunity in which the employer attests, including by signing the Form I-983 or successor form, that:
(i) The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available and is prepared to provide appropriate training in connection with the specified opportunity at the location(s) specified in the Form I-983 or successor form;
(ii) The student on a STEM OPT extension will not replace a full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. worker; and
(iii) The student's opportunity assists the student in reaching his or her training goals.
(11) Site visits. DHS, at its discretion, may conduct a site visit of any employer. The purpose of the site visit is for DHS to ensure that each employer possesses and maintains the ability and resources to provide structured and guided work-based learning experiences consistent with any Form I-983 or successor form completed and signed by the employer. DHS will provide notice to the employer 48 hours in advance of any site visit, except notice may not be provided if the visit is triggered by a complaint or other evidence of noncompliance with the regulations in this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C).
(D) Duration of status while on post-completion OPT. For a student with approved post-completion OPT, the duration of status is defined as the period beginning on the date that the student's application for OPT was properly filed and pending approval, including the authorized period of post-completion OPT, and ending 60 days after the OPT employment authorization expires.
(E) Periods of unemployment during post-completion OPT. During post-completion OPT, F-1 status is dependent upon employment. Students may not accrue an aggregate of more than 90 days of unemployment during any post-completion OPT period described in 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B). Students granted a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section may not accrue an aggregate of more than 150 days of unemployment during a total OPT period, including any post-completion OPT period described in 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B) and any subsequent 24-month extension period.
(11) OPT application and approval process—(i) Student responsibilities. A student must initiate the OPT application process by requesting a recommendation for OPT from his or her DSO. Upon making the recommendation, the DSO will provide the student a signed Form I-20 indicating that recommendation.
(A) Applications for employment authorization. The student must properly file an Application for Employment Authorization, Form I-765 or successor form, with USCIS, accompanied by the required fee, and the supporting documents, as described in the form's instructions.
(B) Applications and filing deadlines for pre-completion OPT and post-completion OPT—(1) Pre-completion OPT. For pre-completion OPT, the student may properly file his or her Form I-765 or successor form up to 90 days before being enrolled for one full academic year, provided that the period of employment will not start prior to the completion of the full academic year.
(2) Post-completion OPT. For post-completion OPT, not including a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) of this section, the student may properly file his or her Form I-765 or successor form up to 90 days prior to his or her program end date and no later than 60 days after his or her program end date. The student must also file his or her Form I-765 or successor form with USCIS within 30 days of the date the DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into his or her SEVIS record.
(C) Applications and filing deadlines for 24-month OPT extension. A student meeting the eligibility requirements for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section may request an extension of employment authorization by filing Form I-765 or successor form, with the required fee and supporting documents, up to 90 days prior to the expiration date of the student's current OPT employment authorization. The student seeking such 24-month OPT extension must properly file his or her Form I-765 or successor form with USCIS within 60 days of the date the DSO enters the recommendation for the OPT extension into his or her SEVIS record. If a student timely and properly files an application for such 24-month OPT extension and timely and properly requests a DSO recommendation, including by submitting the fully executed Form I-983 or successor form to his or her DSO, but the Employment Authorization Document, Form I-766 or successor form, currently in the student's possession expires prior to the decision on the student's application for the OPT extension, the student's Form I-766 or successor form is extended automatically pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(6)(iv).
(D) Start of OPT employment. A student may not begin OPT employment prior to the approved start date on his or her Employment Authorization Document, Form I-766 or successor form, except as described in paragraph (f)(11)(i)(C) of this section. A student may not request a start date that is more than 60 days after the student's program end date. Employment authorization will begin on the date requested or the date the employment authorization is adjudicated, whichever is later.
(ii) Additional DSO responsibilities. A student must have a recommendation from his or her DSO in order to apply for OPT. When a DSO recommends a student for OPT, the school assumes the added responsibility for maintaining the SEVIS record of that student for the entire period of authorized OPT, consistent with paragraph (f)(12) of this section.
(A) Prior to making a recommendation, the DSO at the educational institution of the student's most recent enrollment must ensure that the student is eligible for the given type and period of OPT and that the student is aware of the student's responsibilities for maintaining status while on OPT. Prior to recommending a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section, the DSO at the educational institution of the student's most recent enrollment must certify that the student's degree being used to qualify that student for the 24-month OPT extension, as shown in SEVIS or official transcripts, is a bachelor's, master's, or doctorate degree with a degree code that is contained within a category on the current STEM Designated Degree Program List at the time the recommendation is made. A DSO may recommend a student for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section only if the Form I-983 or successor form described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(7) of this section has been properly completed and executed by the student and prospective employer. A DSO may not recommend a student for an OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section if the practical training would be conducted by an employer who has failed to meet the requirements under paragraphs (f)(10)(ii)(C)(5) through (9) of this section or has failed to provide the required assurances of paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(10) of this section.
(B) The DSO must update the student's SEVIS record with the DSO's recommendation for OPT before the student can apply to USCIS for employment authorization. The DSO will indicate in SEVIS whether the OPT employment is to be full-time or part-time, or for a student seeking a recommendation for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section whether the OPT employment meets the minimum hours requirements described in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C)(8) of this section, and note in SEVIS the OPT start and end dates.
(C) The DSO must provide the student with a signed, dated Form I-20 or successor form indicating that OPT has been recommended.
(iii) Decision on application for OPT employment authorization. USCIS will adjudicate a student's Form I-765 or successor form on the basis of the DSO's recommendation and other eligibility considerations.
(A) If granted, the employment authorization period for post-completion OPT begins on the requested date of commencement or the date the Form I-765 or successor form is approved, whichever is later, and ends at the conclusion of the remaining time period of post-completion OPT eligibility. The employment authorization period for a 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section begins on the day after the expiration of the initial post-completion OPT employment authorization and ends 24 months thereafter, regardless of the date the actual extension is approved.
(B) USCIS will notify the applicant of the decision on the Form I-765 or successor form in writing, and, if the application is denied, of the reason or reasons for the denial.
(C) The applicant may not appeal the decision.
(12) Reporting while on optional practical training—(i) General. An F-1 student who is granted employment authorization by USCIS to engage in optional practical training is required to report any change of name or address, or interruption of such employment to the DSO for the duration of the optional practical training. A DSO who recommends a student for OPT is responsible for updating the student's record to reflect these reported changes for the duration of the time that training is authorized.
(ii) Additional reporting obligations for students with an approved 24-month OPT extension. Students with an approved 24-month OPT extension under paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section have additional reporting obligations. Compliance with these reporting requirements is required to maintain F-1 status. The reporting obligations are:
(A) Within 10 days of the change, the student must report to the student's DSO a change of legal name, residential or mailing address, employer name, employer address, and/or loss of employment.
(B) The student must complete a validation report, confirming that the information required by paragraph (f)(12)(ii)(A) of this section has not changed, every six months. The requirement for validation reporting starts on the date the 24-month OPT extension begins and ends when the student's F-1 status expires or the 24-month OPT extension concludes, whichever is first. The validation report is due to the student's DSO within 10 business days of each reporting date.
(13) Temporary absence from the United States of F-1 student granted employment authorization. (i) A student returning from a temporary trip abroad with an unexpired off-campus employment authorization on his or her I-20 ID may resume employment only if the student is readmitted to attend the same school which granted the employment authorization.
(ii) An F-1 student who has an unexpired EAD issued for post-completion practical training and who is otherwise admissible may return to the United States to resume employment after a period of temporary absence. The EAD must be used in combination with an I-20 ID endorsed for reentry by the DSO within the last six months.
(14) Effect of strike or other labor dispute. Any employment authorization, whether or not part of an academic program, is automatically suspended upon certification by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's designee to the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service or the Commissioner's designee, that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place of employment. As used in this paragraph, “place of employment” means the facility or facilities where a labor dispute exists. The employer is prohibited from transferring F-1 students working at other facilities to the facility where the work stoppage is occurring.
(15) Spouse and children of F-1 student. The F-2 spouse and minor children of an F-1 student shall each be issued an individual SEVIS Form I-20 in accordance with the provisions of §214.3(k).
(i) Employment. The F-2 spouse and children of an F-1 student may not accept employment.
(ii) Study—(A) F-2 post-secondary/vocational study—(1) Authorized study at SEVP-certified schools. An F-2 spouse or F-2 child may enroll in less than a full course of study, as defined in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) and (m)(9)(i) through (iv), in any course of study described in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) or (m)(9)(i) through (iv) of this section at an SEVP-certified school. Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(B) and (m)(9)(i) of this section, study at an undergraduate college or university or at a community college or junior college is not a full course of study solely because the F-2 nonimmigrant is engaging in a lesser course load to complete a course of study during the current term. An F-2 spouse or F-2 child enrolled in less than a full course of study is not eligible to engage in employment pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9) and (10) of this section or pursuant to paragraph (m)(14) of this section.
(2) Full course of study. Subject to paragraphs (f)(15)(ii)(B) and (f)(18) of this section, an F-2 spouse and child may engage in a full course of study only by applying for and obtaining a change of status to F-1, M-1 or J-1 nonimmigrant status, as appropriate, before beginning a full course of study. An F-2 spouse and child may engage in study that is avocational or recreational in nature, up to and including on a full-time basis.
(B) F-2 elementary or secondary study. An F-2 child may engage in full-time study, including any full course of study, in any elementary or secondary school (kindergarten through twelfth grade).
(C) An F-2 spouse and child violates his or her nonimmigrant status by enrolling in any study except as provided in paragraph (f)(15)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(16) Reinstatement to student status—(i) General. The district director may consider reinstating a student who makes a request for reinstatement on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, accompanied by a properly completed SEVIS Form I-20 indicating the DSO's recommendation for reinstatement (or a properly completed Form I-20A-B issued prior to January 30, 2003, from the school the student is attending or intends to attend prior to August 1, 2003). The district director may consider granting the request if the student:
(A) Has not been out of status for more than 5 months at the time of filing the request for reinstatement (or demonstrates that the failure to file within the 5 month period was the result of exceptional circumstances and that the student filed the request for reinstatement as promptly as possible under these exceptional circumstances);
(B) Does not have a record of repeated or willful violations of Service regulations;
(C) Is currently pursuing, or intending to pursue, a full course of study in the immediate future at the school which issued the Form I-20;
(D) Has not engaged in unauthorized employment;
(E) Is not deportable on any ground other than section 237(a)(1)(B) or (C)(i) of the Act; and
(F) Establishes to the satisfaction of the Service, by a detailed showing, either that:
(1) The violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond the student's control. Such circumstances might include serious injury or illness, closure of the institution, a natural disaster, or inadvertence, oversight, or neglect on the part of the DSO, but do not include instances where a pattern of repeated violations or where a willful failure on the part of the student resulted in the need for reinstatement; or
(2) The violation relates to a reduction in the student's course load that would have been within a DSO's power to authorize, and that failure to approve reinstatement would result in extreme hardship to the student.
(ii) Decision. If the Service reinstates the student, the Service shall endorse the student's copy of Form I-20 to indicate the student has been reinstated and return the form to the student. If the Form I-20 is from a non-SEVIS school, the school copy will be forwarded to the school. If the Form I-20 is from a SEVIS school, the adjudicating officer will update SEVIS to reflect the Service's decision. In either case, if the Service does not reinstate the student, the student may not appeal that decision.
(17) Current name and address. A student must inform the DSO and the Service of any legal changes to his or her name or of any change of address, within 10 days of the change, in a manner prescribed by the school. A student enrolled at a SEVIS school can satisfy the requirement in 8 CFR 265.1 of notifying the Service by providing a notice of a change of address within 10 days to the DSO, who in turn shall enter the information in SEVIS within 21 days of notification by the student. A student enrolled at a non-SEVIS school must submit a notice of change of address to the Service, as provided in 8 CFR 265.1, within 10 days of the change. Except in the case of a student who cannot receive mail where he or she resides, the address provided by the student must be the actual physical location where the student resides rather than a mailing address. In cases where a student provides a mailing address, the school must maintain a record of, and must provide upon request from the Service, the actual physical location where the student resides.
(18) Special rules for certain border commuter students—(i) Applicability. For purposes of the special rules in this paragraph (f)(18), the term “border commuter student” means a national of Canada or Mexico who is admitted to the United States as an F-1 nonimmigrant student to enroll in a full course of study, albeit on a part-time basis, in an approved school located within 75 miles of a United States land border. A border commuter student must maintain actual residence and place of abode in the student's country of nationality, and seek admission to the United States at a land border port-of-entry. These special rules do not apply to a national of Canada or Mexico who is:
(A) Residing in the United States while attending an approved school as an F-1 student, or
(B) Enrolled in a full course of study as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section.
(ii) Full course of study. The border commuter student must be enrolled in a full course of study at the school that leads to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective, albeit on a part-time basis. A designated school official at the school may authorize an eligible border commuter student to enroll in a course load below that otherwise required for a full course of study under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, provided that the reduced course load is consistent with the border commuter student's approved course of study.
(iii) Period of admission. An F-1 nonimmigrant student who is admitted as a border commuter student under this paragraph (f)(18) will be admitted until a date certain. The DSO is required to specify a completion date on the Form I-20 that reflects the actual semester or term dates for the commuter student's current term of study. A new Form I-20 will be required for each new semester or term that the border commuter student attends at the school. The provisions of paragraphs (f)(5) and (f)(7) of this section, relating to duration of status and extension of stay, are not applicable to a border commuter student.
(iv) Employment. A border commuter student may not be authorized to accept any employment in connection with his or her F-1 student status, except for curricular practical training as provided in paragraph (f)(10)(i) of this section or post-completion optional practical training as provided in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(A)(3) of this section.
(19) Remittance of the fee. An alien who applies for F-1 or F-3 nonimmigrant status in order to enroll in a program of study at a Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-approved educational institution is required to pay the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee to DHS, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.13, except as otherwise provided in that section.

Each exchange alien participating in a program of graduate medical education or training shall file Form I-644 (Supplementary Statement for Graduate Medical Trainees) annually with the Service attesting to the conditions as specified on the form. The exchange alien shall also submit Form I-644 as an attachment to a completed Form DS-2019 when applying for an extension of stay.
When the approval of an exchange visitor program is withdrawn by the Director of the United States Information Agency, the district director shall send a notice of the withdrawal to each participant in the program and a copy of each such notice shall be sent to the program sponsor. If the exchange visitor is currently engaged in activities authorized by the cancelled program, the participant is authorized to remain in the United States to engage in those activities until expiration of the period of stay previously authorized. The district director shall notify participants in cancelled programs that permission to remain in the United States as an exchange visitor, or extension of stay may be obtained if the participant is accepted in another approved program and a Form DS-2019, executed by the new program sponsor, is submitted. In this case, a release from the sponsor of the cancelled program will not be required.

(m) Students in established vocational or other recognized nonacademic institutions, other than in language training programs—(1) Admission of student—(i) Eligibility for admission. A nonimmigrant student may be admitted into the United States in nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(M) of the Act, if:
(A) The student presents a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in his or her own name by a school approved by the Service for attendance by M-1 foreign students. (In the alternative, for a student seeking admission prior to August 1, 2003, the student may present a currently-valid Form I-20M-N/I-20ID, if that form was issued by the school prior to January 30, 2003);
(B) The student has documentary evidence of financial support in the amount indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20M-N/I-20ID); and
(C) For students seeking initial admission only, the student intends to attend the school specified in the student's visa (or, where the student is exempt from the requirement for a visa, the school indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20M-N/I-20ID)).
(ii) Disposition of Form I-20M-N. When a student is admitted to the United States, the inspecting officer shall forward Form I-20M-N to the Service's processing center. The processing center shall forward Form I-20N to the school which issued the form to notify the school of the student's admission.
(iii) Use of SEVIS. On January 30, 2003, the use of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) will become mandatory for the issuance of any new Form I-20. A student or dependent who presents a non-SEVIS Form I-20 issued on or after January 30, 2003, will not be accepted for admission to the United States. Non-SEVIS Forms I-20 issued prior to January 30, 2003, will continue to be accepted for admission to the United States until August 1, 2003. However, schools must issue a SEVIS Form I-20 to any current student requiring a reportable action (e.g., extension of status, practical training, and requests for employment authorization) or a new Form I-20, or for any aliens who must obtain a new nonimmigrant student visa. As of August 1, 2003, the records of all current or continuing students must be entered in SEVIS.
(2) Form I-20 ID copy. The first time an M-1 student comes into contact with the Service for any reason, the student must present to the Service a Form I-20M-N properly and completely filled out by the student and by the designated official of the school the student is attending or intends to attend. The student will be issued a Form I-20 ID copy with his or her admission number. The student must have the Form I-20 ID copy with him or her at all times. If the student loses the Form I-20 ID copy, the student must request a new Form I-20 ID copy on Form I-102 from the Service office having jurisdiction over the school the student was last authorized to attend.
(3) Admission of the spouse and minor children of an M-1 student. The spouse and minor children accompanying an M-1 student are eligible for admission in M-2 status if the student is admitted in M-1 status. The spouse and minor children following-to-join an M-1 student are eligible for admission to the United States in M-2 status if they are able to demonstrate that the M-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study, or engaged in approved practical training following completion of studies. In either case, at the time they seek admission, the eligible spouse and minor children of an M-1 student with a SEVIS Form I-20 must individually present an original SEVIS Form I-20 issued in the name of each M-2 dependent issued by a school authorized by the Service for attendance by M-1 foreign students. Prior to August 1, 2003, if exigent circumstances are demonstrated, the Service will allow the dependent of an M-1 student in possession of a SEVIS Form I-20 to enter the United States using a copy of the M-1 student's SEVIS Form I-20. (In the alternative, for dependents seeking admission to the United States prior to August 1, 2003, a copy of the M-1 student's current Form I-20ID issued prior to January 30, 2003, with proper endorsement by the DSO will satisfy this requirement.) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or Form I-20M-N) is required for a dependent where there has been any substantive change in the M-1 student's current information.
(i) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued; or
(ii) A new Form I-20M-N if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued.
(4) Temporary absence—(i) General. An M-1 student returning to the United States from a temporary absence to attend the school which the student was previously authorized to attend must present either—
(A) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued; or
(B) A new Form I-20M-N if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued.
(ii) Student who transferred between schools. If an M-1 student has been authorized to transfer between schools and is returning to the United States from a temporary absence in order to attend the school to which transfer was authorized as indicated on the student's Form I-20 ID copy, the name of the school to which the student is destined does not need to be specified in the student's visa.
(5) Period of stay. A student in M nonimmigrant status is admitted for a fixed time period, which is the period necessary to complete the course of study indicated on the Form I-20, plus practical training following completion of the course of study, plus an additional 30 days to depart the United States, but not to exceed a total period of one year. An M-1 student may be admitted for a period up to 30 days before the report date or start date of the course of study listed on the Form I-20. An M-1 student who fails to maintain a full course of study or otherwise fails to maintain status is not eligible for the additional 30-day period of stay.
(6)-(8) [Reserved]
(9) Full course of study. Successful completion of the course of study must lead to the attainment of a specific educational or vocational objective. A “full course of study” as required by section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act means—
(i) Study at a community college or junior college, certified by a school official to consist of at least twelve semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter-hour systems, where all students enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or considered full-time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the district director) except when the student needs a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term;
(ii) Study at a postsecondary vocational or business school, other than in a language training program except as provided in §214.3(a)(2)(iv), which confers upon its graduates recognized associate or other degrees or has established that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning which are either: (1) A school (or school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof; or (2) a school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; and which has been certified by a designated school official to consist of at least twelve hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by the district director;
(iii) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic curriculum, other than in a language training program except as provided in §214.3(a)(2)(iv), certified by a designated school official to consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or at least twenty-two clock hours a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of shop or laboratory work; or
(iv) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic high school curriculum, certified by a designated school official to consist of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress towards graduation.
(v) On-line courses/distance education programs. No on-line or distance education classes may be considered to count toward an M-1 student's full course of study requirement if such classes do not require the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to completion of the class. An on-line or distance education course is a course that is offered principally through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing.
(vi) Reduced course load. The designated school official may authorize an M-1 student to engage in less than a full course of study only where the student has been compelled by illness or a medical condition that has been documented by a licensed medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or licensed clinical psychologist, to interrupt or reduce his or her course of study. A DSO may not authorize a reduced course load for more than an aggregate of 5 months per course of study. An M-1 student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to illness or medical condition for an aggregate of 5 months, may not be authorized by the DSO to reduce his or her course load on subsequent occasions during his or her particular course of study.
(A) Non-SEVIS schools. A DSO must report any student who has been authorized by the DSO to carry a reduced course load. Within 21 days of the authorization, the DSO must send a photocopy of the student's Form I-20 to the Service's data processing center indicating the date that authorization was granted. The DSO must also report to the Service's data processing center when the student has resumed a full course of study, no more than 21 days from the date the student resumed a full course of study. In this case, the DSO must submit a photocopy of the student's Form I-20 indicating the date that a full course of study was resumed, with a new program end date.
(B) SEVIS reporting. In order for a student to be authorized to drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS prior to the student reducing his or her course load. The DSO must update SEVIS with the date, reason for authorization, and the start date of the next term or session. The DSO must also notify SEVIS within 21 days of the student's commencement of a full course of study.

(10) Extension of stay—(i) Eligibility. The cumulative time of extensions that can be granted to an M-1 student is limited to a period of 3 years from the M-1 student's original start date, plus 30 days. No extension can be granted to an M-1 student if the M-1 student is unable to complete the course of study within 3 years of the original program start date. This limit includes extensions that have been granted due to a drop below full course of study, a transfer of schools, or reinstatement. An M-1 student may be granted an extension of stay if it is established that:
(A) He or she is a bona fide nonimmigrant currently maintaining student status;
(B) Compelling educational or medical reasons have resulted in a delay to his or her course of study. Delays caused by academic probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program extension; and
(C) He or she is able to, and in good faith intends to, continue to maintain that status for the period for which the extension is granted.
(ii) Application. A student must apply to the Service for an extension on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status. A student's M-2 spouse and children seeking an extension of stay must be included in the application. The student must submit the application to the service center having jurisdiction over the school the student is currently authorized to attend, at least 15 days but not more than 60 days before the program end date on the student's Form I-20. The application must also be accompanied by the student's Form I-20 and the Forms I-94 of the student's spouse and children, if applicable.
(iii) Period of stay. If an application for extension is granted, the student and the student's spouse and children, if applicable, are to be given an extension of stay for the period of time necessary to complete the course of study, plus 30 days within which to depart from the United States, or for a total period of one year, whichever is less. A student's M-2 spouse and children are not eligible for an extension unless the M-1 student is granted an extension of stay, or for a longer period than is granted to the M-1 student.
(iv) SEVIS update. A DSO must update SEVIS to recommend that a student be approved for an extension of stay. The SEVIS Form I-20 must be printed with the recommendation and new program end date for submission by mail to the service center, with Form I-539, and Forms I-94 if applicable.
(11) School transfer—(i) Eligibility. An M-1 student may not transfer to another school after six months from the date the student is first admitted as, or changes nonimmigrant classification to that of, an M-1 student unless the student is unable to remain at the school to which the student was initially admitted due to circumstances beyond the student's control. An M-1 student may be otherwise eligible to transfer to another school if the student—
(A) Is a bona fide nonimmigrant;
(B) Has been pursuing a full course of study at the school the student was last authorized to attend;
(C) Intends to pursue a full course of study at the school to which the student intends to transfer; and
(D) Is financially able to attend the school to which the student intends to transfer.
(ii) Procedure. A student must apply to the Service on Form I-539 for permission to transfer between schools. Upon application for school transfer, a student may effect the transfer subject to approval of the application. A student who transfers without complying with this requirement or whose application is denied after transfer pursuant to this regulation is considered to be out of status. If the application is approved, the approval of the transfer will be determined to be the program start date listed on the Form I-20, and the student will be granted an extension of stay for the period of time necessary to complete the new course of study plus 30 days, or for a total period of one year, whichever is less.
(A) Non-SEVIS school. The application must be accompanied by the Form I-20ID copy and the Form I-94 of the student's spouse and children, if applicable. The Form I-539 must also be accompanied by Form I-20M-N properly and completely filled out by the student and by the designated official of the school which the student wishes to attend. Upon approval, the adjudicating officer will endorse the name of the school to which the transfer is authorized on the student's Form I-20ID copy and return it to the student. The officer will also endorse Form I-20M-N to indicate that a school transfer has been authorized and forward it to the Service's processing center for updating. The processing center will forward Form I-20M-N to the school to which the transfer has been authorized to notify the school of the action taken.
(B) SEVIS school. The student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and indicate the school to which the student intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school must update SEVIS to show the student as a “transfer out” and input the “release date” for transfer. Once updated as a “transfer out” the transfer school is permitted to generate a SEVIS Form I-20 for transfer but will not gain access to the student's SEVIS record until the release date is reached. Upon receipt of the SEVIS Form I-20 from the transfer school, the student must submit Form I-539 in accordance with §214.2(m)(11). The student may enroll in the transfer school at the next available term or session and is required to notify the DSO of the transfer school immediately upon beginning attendance. The transfer school must update the student's registration record in SEVIS in accordance with §214.3(g)(3). Upon approval of the transfer application, the Service officer will endorse the name of the school to which the transfer is authorized on the student's SEVIS Form I-20 and return it to the student.
(C) Transition process. Once SEVIS is fully operational and interfaced with the service center benefit processing system, the Service officer will transmit the approval of the transfer to SEVIS and endorse the name of the school to which transfer is authorized on the student's SEVIS Form I-20 and return it to the student. As part of a transitional process until that time, the student is required to notify the DSO at the transfer school of the decision of the Service within 15 days of the receipt of the adjudication by the Service. Upon notification by the student of the approval of the Service, the DSO must immediately update SEVIS to show that approval of the transfer has been granted. The DSO must then print an updated SEVIS Form I-20 for the student indicating that the transfer has been completed. If the application for transfer is denied, the student is out of status and the DSO must terminate the student's record in SEVIS.
(iii) Student who has not been pursuing a full course of study. If an M-1 student who has not been pursuing a full course of study at the school the student was last authorized to attend desires to attend a different school, the student must apply for reinstatement to student status under paragraph (m)(16) of this section.
(12) Change in educational objective. An M-1 student may not change educational objective.
(13) Employment. Except as provided in paragraph (m)(14) of this section, a student may not accept employment.
(14) Practical training—(i) When practical training may be authorized. Temporary employment for practical training may be authorized only after completion of the student's course of study.
(A) The proposed employment is recommended for the purpose of practical training;
(B) The proposed employment is related to the student's course of study; and
(C) Upon the designated school official's information and belief, employment comparable to the proposed employment is not available to the student in the country of the student's foreign residence.
(ii) Application. A M-1 student must apply for permission to accept employment for practical training on Form I-765, with fee as contained in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), accompanied by a Form I-20 that has been endorsed for practical training by the designated school official. The application must be submitted prior to the program end date listed on the student's Form I-20 but not more than 90 days before the program end date. The designated school official must certify on Form I-538 that—
(A) The proposed employment is recommended for the purpose of practical training;
(B) The proposed employment is related to the student's course of study; and
(C) Upon the designated school official's information and belief, employment comparable to the proposed employment is not available to the student in the country of the student's foreign residence.
(iii) Duration of practical training. When the student is authorized to engage in employment for practical training, he or she will be issued an employment authorization document. The M-1 student may not begin employment until he or she has been issued an employment authorization document by the Service. One month of employment authorization will be granted for each four months of full-time study that the M-1 student has completed. However, an M-1 student may not engage in more than six months of practical training in the aggregate. The student will not be granted employment authorization if he or she cannot complete the requested practical training within six months.
(iv) Temporary absence of M-1 student granted practical training. An M-1 student who has been granted permission to accept employment for practical training and who temporarily departs from the United States, may be readmitted for the remainder of the authorized period indicated on the student's Form I-20 ID copy. The student must be returning to the United States to perform the authorized practical training. A student may not be readmitted to begin practical training which was not authorized prior to the student's departure from the United States.
(v) Effect of strike or other labor dispute. Authorization for all employment for practical training is automatically suspended upon certification by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's designee to the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization or the Commissioner's designee that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place of employment. As used in this paragraph, “place of employment” means wherever the employer or joint employer does business.
(vi) SEVIS process. The DSO must update the student's record in SEVIS to recommend that the Service approve the student for practical training, and print SEVIS Form I-20 with the recommendation, for the student to submit to the Service with Form I-765 as provided in this paragraph (m)(14).
(15) Decision on application for extension, permission to transfer to another school, or permission to accept employment for practical training. The Service shall notify the applicant of the decision and, if the application is denied, of the reason(s) for the denial. The applicant may not appeal the decision.
(16) Reinstatement to student status—(i) General. A district director may consider reinstating a student who makes a request for reinstatement on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, accompanied by a properly completed SEVIS Form I-20 indicating the DSO's recommendation for reinstatement (or a properly completed Form I-20M-N issued prior to January 30, 2003, from the school the student is attending or intends to attend prior to August 1, 2003). The district director may consider granting the request only if the student:
(A) Has not been out of status for more than 5 months at the time of filing the request for reinstatement (or demonstrates that the failure to file within the 5 month period was the result of exceptional circumstances and that the student filed the request for reinstatement as promptly as possible under these exceptional circumstances);
(B) Does not have a record of repeated or willful violations of the Service regulations;
(C) Is currently pursuing, or intends to pursue, a full course of study at the school which issued the Form I-20M-N or SEVIS Form I-20;
(D) Has not engaged in unlawful employment;
(E) Is not deportable on any ground other than section 237(a)(1)(B) or (C)(i) of the Act; and
(F) Establishes to the satisfaction of the Service, by a detailed showing, either that:
(1) The violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond the student's control. Such circumstances might include serious injury or illness, closure of the institution, a natural disaster, or inadvertence, oversight or neglect on the part of the DSO, but do not include instances where a pattern of repeated violations or where a willful failure on the part of the student resulted in the need for reinstatement; or
(2) The violation relates to a reduction in the student's course load that would have been within a DSO's power to authorize, and that failure to approve reinstatement would result in extreme hardship to the student.
(ii) Decision. If the Service reinstates the student, the Service shall endorse the student's copy of Form I-20 to indicate that the student has been reinstated and return the form to the student. If the Form I-20 is from a non-SEVIS school, the school copy will be forwarded to the school. If the Form I-20 is from a SEVIS school, the adjudicating officer will update SEVIS to reflect the Service's decision. In either case, if the Service does not reinstate the student, the student may not appeal the decision. The district director will send notification to the school of the decision.
(17) Spouse and children of M-1 student. The M-2 spouse and minor children of an M-1 student shall each be issued an individual SEVIS Form I-20 in accordance with the provisions of §214.3(k).
(i) Employment. The M-2 spouse and children may not accept employment.
(ii) Study—(A) M-2 post-secondary/vocational study—(1) Authorized study at SEVP-certified schools. An M-2 spouse or M-2 child may enroll in less than a full course of study, as defined in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) or (m)(9)(i) through (v), in any course of study described in paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) through (D) or (m)(9)(i) through (v) of this section at an SEVP-certified school. Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(B) and (m)(9)(i) of this section, study at an undergraduate college or university or at a community college or junior college is not a full course of study solely because the M-2 nonimmigrant is engaging in a lesser course load to complete a course of study during the current term. An M-2 spouse or M-2 child enrolled in less than a full course of study is not eligible to engage in employment pursuant to paragraph (m)(14) of this section or pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9) through (10) of this section.
(2) Full course of study. Subject to paragraph (m)(17)(ii)(B) of this section, an M-2 spouse and child may engage in a full course of study only by applying for and obtaining a change of status to F-1, M-1, or J-1 status, as appropriate, before beginning a full course of study. An M-2 spouse and M-2 child may engage in study that is avocational or recreational in nature, up to and including on a full-time basis.
(B) M-2 elementary or secondary study. An M-2 child may engage in full-time study, including any full course of study, in any elementary or secondary school (kindergarten through twelfth grade).
(C) An M-2 spouse or child violates his or her nonimmigrant status by enrolling in any study except as provided in paragraph (m)(17)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(18) Current name and address. A student must inform the Service and the DSO of any legal changes to his or her name or of any change of address, within 10 days of the change, in a manner prescribed by the school. A student enrolled at a SEVIS school can satisfy the requirement in 8 CFR 265.1 of notifying the Service by providing a notice of a change of address within 10 days to the DSO, and the DSO in turn shall enter the information in SEVIS within 21 days of notification by the student. A nonimmigrant student enrolled at a non-SEVIS institution must submit a notice of change of address to the Service, as provided in 8 CFR 265.1, within 10 days of the change. Except in the case of a student who cannot receive mail where he or she resides, the address provided by the student must be the actual physical location where the student resides rather than a mailing address. In cases where a student provides a mailing address, the school must maintain a record of, and must provide upon request from the Service, the actual physical location where the student resides.
(19) Special rules for certain border commuter students—(i) Applicability. For purposes of the special rules in this paragraph (m)(19), the term “border commuter student” means a national of Canada or Mexico who is admitted to the United States as an M-1 student to enroll in a full course of study, albeit on a part-time basis, in an approved school located within 75 miles of a United States land border. The border commuter student must maintain actual residence and place of abode in the student's country of nationality, and seek admission to the United States at a land border port-of-entry. These special rules do not apply to a national of Canada or Mexico who is:
(A) Residing in the United States while attending an approved school as an M-1 student, or
(B) Enrolled in a full course of study as defined in paragraph (m)(9) of this section.
(ii) Full course of study. The border commuter student must be enrolled in a full course of study at the school that leads to the attainment of a specific educational or vocational objective, albeit on a part-time basis. A designated school official at the school may authorize an eligible border commuter student to enroll in a course load below that otherwise required for a full course of study under paragraph (m)(9) of this section, provided that the reduced course load is consistent with the border commuter student's approved course of study.
(iii) Period of stay. An M-1 border commuter student is not entitled to an additional 30-day period of stay otherwise available under paragraph (m)(5) of this section.
(iv) Employment. A border commuter student may not be authorized to accept any employment in connection with his or her M-1 student status, except for practical training as provided in paragraph (m)(14) of this section.
(20) Remittance of the fee. An alien who applies for M-1 or M-3 nonimmigrant status in order to enroll in a program of study at a DHS-approved vocational educational institution is required to pay the SEVIS fee to DHS, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.13, except as otherwise provided in that section.

(a) Filing petition—
(1) General. A school or school system seeking initial or continued authorization for attendance by nonimmigrant students under sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act, or both, must file a petition for certification or recertification with SEVP, using the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), in accordance with the procedures at paragraph (h) of this section. The petition must state whether the school or school system is seeking certification or recertification for attendance of nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act or both. The petition must identify by name and address each location of the school that is included in the petition for certification or recertification, specifically including any physical location in which a nonimmigrant can attend classes through the school (i.e., campus, extension campuses, satellite campuses, etc.).
(i) School systems. A school system, as used in this section, means public school (grades 9-12) or private school (grades kindergarten-12). A petition by a school system must include a list of the names and addresses of those schools included in the petition with the supporting documents.
(ii) Submission requirements. Certification and recertification petitions require that a complete Form I-17, Petition for Approval of School for Attendance by Nonimmigrant Student, including supplements A and B and bearing original signatures, be included with the school's submission of supporting documentation. In submitting the Form I-17, a school certifies that the designated school officials (DSOs) signing the form have read and understand DHS regulations relating to: Nonimmigrant students at 8 CFR 214.1, 214.2(f), and/or 214.2(m); change of nonimmigrant classification for students at 8 CFR 248; school certification and recertification under this section; withdrawal of school certification under this section and 8 CFR 214.4; that both the school and its DSOs intend to comply with these regulations at all times; and that, to the best of its knowledge, the school is eligible for SEVP certification. Willful misstatements may constitute perjury (18 U.S.C. 1621).
(2) Approval for F-1 or M-1 classification, or both—(i) F-1 classification. The following schools may be approved for attendance by nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act:
(A) A college or university, i.e., an institution of higher learning which awards recognized bachelor's, master's doctor's or professional degrees.
(B) A community college or junior college which provides instruction in the liberal arts or in the professions and which awards recognized associate degrees.
(C) A seminary.
(D) A conservatory.
(E) An academic high school.
(F) A private elementary school.
(G) An institution which provides language training, instruction in the liberal arts or fine arts, instruction in the professions, or instruction or training in more than one of these disciplines.
(ii) M-1 classification. The following schools are considered to be vocational or nonacademic institutions and may be approved for attendance by nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act:
(A) A community college or junior college which provides vocational or technical training and which awards recognized associate degrees.
(B) A vocational high school.
(C) A school which provides vocational or nonacademic training other than language training.
(iii) Both F-1 and M-1 classification. A school may be approved for attendance by nonimmigrant students under both sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) and 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act if it has both instruction in the liberal arts, fine arts, language, religion, or the professions and vocational or technical training. In that case, a student whose primary intent is to pursue studies in liberal arts, fine arts, language, religion, or the professions at the school is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act. A student whose primary intent is to pursue vocational or technical training at the school is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act.
(iv) English language training for a vocational student. A student whose primary intent is to pursue vocational or technical training who takes English language training at the same school solely for the purpose of being able to understand the vocational or technical course of study is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act.
(v) The following may not be approved for attendance by foreign students:
(A) A home school,
(B) A public elementary school, or
(C) An adult education program, as defined by section 203(l) of the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, Public Law 105-220, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 9202(l), if the adult education program is funded in whole or in part by a grant under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, or by any other Federal, State, county or municipal funding.

(A) Remains eligible for certification in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section;
(B) Has complied during its previous period of certification or recertification with recordkeeping, retention, and reporting requirements and all other requirements of paragraphs (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section.
(b) Supporting documents. Institutions petitioning for certification or recertification must submit certain supporting documents as follows, pursuant to sections 101(a)(15)(F) and (M) of the Act. A petitioning school or school system owned and operated as a public educational institution or system by the United States or a State or a political subdivision thereof shall submit a certification to that effect signed by the appropriate public official who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so. A petitioning private or parochial elementary or secondary school system shall submit a certification signed by the appropriate public official who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so to the effect that it meets the requirements of the State or local public educational system. Any other petitioning school shall submit a certification by the appropriate licensing, approving, or accrediting official who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so to the effect that it is licensed, approved, or accredited. In lieu of such certification a school which offers courses recognized by a State-approving agency as appropriate for study for veterans under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3675 and 3676 may submit a statement of recognition signed by the appropriate official of the State approving agency who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do so. A charter shall not be considered a license, approval, or accreditation. A school catalogue, if one is issued, shall also be submitted with each petition. If not included in the catalogue, or if a catalogue is not issued, the school shall furnish a written statement containing information concerning the size of its physical plant, nature of its facilities for study and training, educational, vocational or professional qualifications of the teaching staff, salaries of the teachers, attendance and scholastic grading policy, amount and character of supervisory and consultative services available to students and trainees, and finances (including a certified copy of the accountant's last statement of school's net worth, income, and expenses). Neither a catalogue nor such a written statement need be included with a petition submitted by:
(1) A school or school system owned and operated as a public educational institution or system by the United States or a State or a political subdivision thereof;
(2) A school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; or
(3) A secondary school operated by or as part of a school so accredited.
(c) Other evidence. If the petitioner is a vocational, business, or language school, or American institution of research recognized as such by the Secretary of Homeland Security, it must submit evidence that its courses of study are accepted as fulfilling the requirements for the attainment of an educational, professional, or vocational objective, and are not avocational or recreational in character. If the petitioner is a vocational, business, or language school, or American institution of research recognized as such by the Attorney General, it must submit evidence that its courses of study are accepted as fulfilling the requirements for the attainment of an educational, professional, or vocational objective, and are not avocational or recreational in character. If the petitioner is an institution of higher education and is not within the category described in paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section, it must submit evidence that it confers upon its graduates recognized bachelor, master, doctor, professional, or divinity degrees, or if it does not confer such degrees that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three such institutions of higher learning. If the petitioner is an elementary or secondary school and is not within the category described in paragraph (b) (1) or (3) of this section, it must submit evidence that attendance at the petitioning institution satisfies the compulsory attendance requirements of the State in which it is located and that the petitioning school qualifies graduates for acceptance by schools of a higher educational level within the category described in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section.
(d) Interview of petitioner. The petitioner or an authorized representative of the petitioner may be required to appear in person before or be interviewed by telephone by a DHS representative prior to the adjudication of a petition for certification or recertification. The interview will be conducted under oath.
(e) Notices to schools related to certification or recertification petitions or to out-of-cycle review—(1) General. All notices from SEVP to schools or school systems related to school certification, recertification, or out-of-cycle review (including, but not limited to, notices related to the collection of evidence, testimony, and appearance pertaining to petitions for recertification encompassing compliance with the recordkeeping, retention and reporting, and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section, as well as to eligibility) will be served in accordance with the procedures at 8 CFR 103.2(b)(1), (4)-(16), (18) and (19), with the exception that all procedures will be conducted by SEVP, the SEVP Director, and the Assistant Secretary, ICE, as appropriate, and except as provided in this section. All such notices will be served (i.e., generated and transmitted) through SEVIS and/or by e-mail. The date of service is the date of transmission of the e-mail notice. DSOs must maintain current contact information, including current e-mail addresses, at all times. Failure of a school to receive SEVP notices due to inaccurate DSO e-mail addresses in SEVIS or blockages of the school's e-mail system caused by spam filters is not grounds for appeal of a denial or withdrawal. The term “in writing” means either a paper copy bearing original signatures or an electronic copy bearing electronic signatures.
(2) SEVP approval notification and SEVIS updating by certified schools. SEVP will notify the petitioner by updating SEVIS to reflect approval of the petition and by e-mail upon approval of a certification or recertification petition. The certification or recertification is valid only for the type of program and nonimmigrant classification specified in the certification or recertification approval notice. The certification must be recertified every two years and may be subject to out-of-cycle review at any time. Approval may be withdrawn in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4.
(3) Modifications to Form I-17 while a school is SEVP-certified. Any modification made by an SEVP-certified school on the Form I-17 at any time after certification and for the duration of a school's authorization to enroll F and/or M students must be reported to SEVP and will be processed by SEVP in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (f)(1), (g)(2) and (h)(3)(i) of this section.
(4) Notice of Intent to Withdraw (NOIW) SEVP certification—(i) Automatic withdrawal. SEVP will serve the school with an NOIW 30 days prior to a school's SEVP certification expiration date if the school has not submitted to SEVP a completed recertification petition, in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The school will be automatically withdrawn immediately, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(a)(3), if it has not submitted a completed recertification petition by the school's certification expiration date.
(ii) Withdrawal on notice. SEVP will serve a Withdrawal on Notice, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(b), if SEVP determines that a school reviewed out-of-cycle has failed to sustain eligibility or has failed to comply with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section. When a school fails to file an answer to an NOIW within the 30-day period, SEVP will withdraw the school's certification and notify the DSOs of the decision, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(d). Such withdrawal of certification may not be appealed.
(5) Notice of Denial. A Notice of Denial will be served to a school when SEVP denies a petition for initial certification or recertification. The notice will address appeals options. Schools denied recertification must comply with 8 CFR 214.4(i).
(6) Notice of Automatic Withdrawal. Schools that relinquish SEVP certification for any of the reasons cited in 8 CFR 214.4(a)(3) will be served a Notice of Automatic Withdrawal.
(7) Notice of Withdrawal. A school found to be ineligible for continued SEVP certification as a result of an out-of-cycle review will receive a Notice of Withdrawal. Schools withdrawn must comply with 8 CFR 214.4(i).
(8) Notice of SEVIS Access Termination Date. The Notice of SEVIS Access Termination Date gives the official date for the school's denial or withdrawal to be final and SEVIS access to be terminated. In most situations, SEVP will not determine a SEVIS access termination date for that school until the appeals process has concluded and the initial denial or withdrawal has been upheld, in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(i)(3). The school will no longer be able to access SEVIS and SEVP will automatically terminate any remaining Active SEVIS records for that school on that date.
(f) Adjudication of a petition for SEVP certification or recertification — (1) Approval. The school is required to immediately report through SEVIS any change to its school information upon approval of a petition for SEVP certification or recertification. Modification to school information listed in paragraph (h)(3) of this section will require a determination of continued eligibility for certification. The certification or recertification is valid only for the type of program and student specified in the approval notice. The certification may be withdrawn in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.4, is subject to review at any time, and will be reviewed every two years.
(2) Denial. The petitioner will be notified of the reasons for the denial and appeal rights, in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR part 103 and 8 CFR 214.4, if SEVP denies a petition for certification or recertification.

(g) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements — (1) Student records. An SEVP-certified school must keep records containing certain specific information and documents relating to each F-1 or M-1 student to whom it has issued a Form I-20, while the student is attending the school and until the school notifies SEVP, in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, that the student is not pursuing a full course of study. Student information not required for entry in SEVIS may be kept in the school's student system of records, but must be accessible to DSOs. The school must keep a record of having complied with the reporting requirements for at least three years after the student is no longer pursuing a full course of study. The school must maintain records on the student in accordance with paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section if a school recommends reinstatement for a student who is out of status. The school must maintain records on the student for three years from the date of the denial if the reinstatement is denied. The DSO must make the information and documents required by this paragraph available, including academic transcripts, and must furnish them to DHS representatives upon request. Schools must maintain and be able to provide an academic transcript or other routinely maintained student records that reflect the total, unabridged academic history of the student at the institution, in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section. All courses must be recorded in the academic period in which the course was taken and graded. The information and documents that the school must keep on each student are as follows:
(i) Identification of the school, to include name and full address.
(ii) Identification of the student, to include name while in attendance (record any legal name change), date and place of birth, country of citizenship, and school's student identification number.
(iii) Current address where the student and his or her dependents physically reside. In the event the student or his or her dependents cannot receive mail at such physical residence, the school must provide a mailing address in SEVIS. If the mailing address and the physical address are not the same, the school must maintain a record of both mailing and physical addresses and provide the physical location of residence of the student and his or her dependents to DHS upon request.
(iv) Record of coursework. Identify the student's degree program and field of study. For each course, give the periods of enrollment, course identification code and course title; the number of credits or contact hours, and the grade; the number of credits or clock hours, and for credit hour courses the credit unit; the term unit (semester hour, quarter hour, etc.). Include the date of withdrawal if the student withdrew from a course. Show the grade point average for each session or term. Show the cumulative credits or clock hours and cumulative grade point average. Narrative evaluation will be accepted in lieu of grades when the school uses no other type of grading.
(v) Record of transfer credit or clock hours accepted. Type of hours, course identification, grades.
(vi) Academic status. Include the effective date or period if suspended, dismissed, placed on probation, or withdrawn.
(vii) Whether the student has been certified for practical training, and the beginning and end dates of certification.
(viii) Statement of graduation (if applicable). Title of degree or credential received, date conferred, program of study or major.
(ix) Termination date and reason.
(x) The documents referred to in paragraph (k) of this section.
Note to paragraph (g)(1): A DHS officer may request any or all of the data in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (x) of this section on any individual student or class of students upon notice. This notice will be in writing if requested by the school. The school will have three work days to respond to any request for information concerning an individual student, and ten work days to respond to any request for information concerning a class of students. The school will respond orally on the same day the request for information is made if DHS requests information on a student who is being held in custody, and DHS will provide a written notification that the request was made after the fact, if the school so desires. DHS will first attempt to gain information concerning a class of students from DHS record systems.
(2) Reporting changes in student and school information. (i) Schools must update SEVIS with the current information within 21 days of a change in any of the information contained in paragraphs (f)(1) and (h)(3) of this section.
(ii) Schools are also required to report within 21 days any change of the information contained in paragraph (g)(1) or the occurrence of the following events:
(A) Any student who has failed to maintain status or complete his or her program;
(B) A change of the student's or dependent's legal name or U.S. address;
(C) Any student who has graduated early or prior to the program end date listed on SEVIS Form I-20;
(D) Any disciplinary action taken by the school against the student as a result of the student being convicted of a crime; and
(E) Any other notification request not covered by paragraph (g)(1) of this section made by DHS with respect to the current status of the student.
(F) For F-1 students authorized by USCIS to engage in a 17-month extension of OPT,
(1) Any change that the student reports to the school concerning legal name, residential or mailing address, employer name, or employer address; and
(2) The end date of the student's employment reported by a former employer in accordance with §214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(4).
(iii) Each term or session and no later than 30 days after the deadline for registering for classes, schools are required to report the following registration information:
(A) Whether the student has enrolled at the school, dropped below a full course of study without prior authorization by the DSO, or failed to enroll;
(B) The current address of each enrolled student; and
(C) The start date of the student's next session, term, semester, trimester, or quarter. For initial students, the start date is the “program start date” or “report date.” (These terms are used interchangeably.) The DSO may choose a reasonable date to accommodate a student's need to be in attendance for required activities at the school prior to the actual start of classes when determining the report date on the Form I-20. Such required activities may include, but are not limited to, research projects and orientation sessions. The DSO may not, however, indicate a report date more than 30 days prior to the start of classes. The next session start date is the start of classes for continuing students.
(D) Adjustment to the program completion date. Any factors that influence the student's progress toward program completion (e.g., deferred attendance, authorized drop below, program extension) must be reflected by making an adjustment updating the program completion date.
(3) Administrative correction of a student's record. In instances where technological or computer problems on the part of SEVIS cause an error in the student's record, the DSO may request the SEVIS system administrator, without fee, to administratively correct the student's record.
(h) SEVP certification, recertification, out-of-cycle review, and oversight of schools—(1) Certification. A school seeking SEVP certification for attendance by nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(m)(i) of the Act must use SEVIS to file an electronic petition (which compiles the data for the Form I-17) and must submit the nonrefundable certification petition fee on-line.
(i) Filing a petition. The school must access the SEVP Web site at http://www.ice.gov/sevis to file a certification petition in SEVIS. The school will be issued a temporary ID and password in order to access SEVIS to complete and submit an electronic Form I-17. The school must submit the proper nonrefundable certification petition fee as provided in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1).
(ii) Site visit, petition adjudication and school notification. SEVP will conduct a site visit for each petitioning school and its additional schools or campuses. SEVP will contact the school to arrange the site visit. The school must comply with and complete the visit within 30 days after the date SEVP contacts the school to arrange the visit, or the petition for certification will be denied as abandoned. DSOs and school officials that have signed the school's Form I-17 petition must be able to demonstrate to DHS representatives how they obtain access to the regulations cited in the certification as part of the site visit. Paper or electronic access is acceptable. DSOs must be able to extract pertinent citations within the regulations related to their requirements and responsibilities. SEVP will serve a notice of approval and SEVIS will be updated to reflect the school's certification if SEVP approves the school's certification petition.
(iii) Certification denial. SEVP will serve a notice of denial in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section if a school's petition for certification is denied.
(2) Recertification. Schools are required to file a completed petition for SEVP recertification before the school's certification expiration date, which is two years from the date of their previous SEVP certification or recertification expiration date, except for the first recertification cycle after publication of the recertification rule. There is no recertification petition fee. SEVP will review a petitioning school's compliance with the recordkeeping, retention and reporting, and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section, as well as continued eligibility for certification, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(i) Filing of petition for recertification. Schools must submit a completed Form I-17 (including supplements A and B) using SEVIS, and submit a paper copy of the Form I-17 bearing original signatures of all officials. SEVP will notify all DSOs of a previously certified school 180 days prior to the school's certification expiration date that the school may submit a petition for recertification. A school may file its recertification petition at any time after receipt of this notification. A school must submit a complete recertification petition package, as outlined in the submission guidelines, by its certification expiration date. SEVP will send a notice of confirmation of complete filing or rejection to the school upon receipt of any filing of a petition for recertification.
(A) Notice of confirmation assures a school of uninterrupted access to SEVIS while SEVP adjudicates the school's petition for recertification. A school that has complied with the petition submission requirements will continue to have SEVIS access after its certification expiration date while the adjudication for recertification is pending. The school is required to comply with all regulatory recordkeeping, retention and reporting, and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section during the period the petition is pending.
(B) Notice of rejection informs a school that it must take prompt corrective action in regard to its recertification petition prior to its certification expiration date to ensure that its SEVIS access will not be terminated and its petition for recertification will be accepted for adjudication.
(ii) Consequence of failure to petition. SEVP will serve an NOIW to the school 30 days prior to a school's certification expiration date. SEVP will no longer accept a petition for recertification from the school and will immediately withdraw the school's certification if the school does not petition for recertification, abandons its petition, or does not submit a complete recertification petition package by the certification expiration date, in accordance with the automatic withdrawal criteria in 8 CFR 214.4(a)(3). The school must comply with 8 CFR 214.4(i) upon withdrawal.
(iii) School recertification process—(A) General. School recertification reaffirms the petitioning school's eligibility for SEVP certification and the school's compliance with recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section since its previous certification.
(B) Compliance. Assessment by SEVP of a school petitioning for recertification will focus primarily on overall school compliance, but may also include examination of individual DSO compliance as data and circumstances warrant. Past performance of these individuals, whether or not they continue to serve as principal designated school officials (PDSOs) or DSOs, will be considered in any petition for recertification of the school.
(C) On-site review for recertification. All schools are subject to on-site review, at the discretion of SEVP, in conjunction with recertification. The school must comply with and complete an on-site review within 30 days of the notification by a DHS representative of a school that it has been selected for an on-site review for recertification, or the petition for recertification will be denied as abandoned, resulting in the school's withdrawal from SEVIS.
(iv) Recertification approval. SEVP will serve a notice of approval if a school's petition for recertification is approved. The date of the subsequent recertification review will be two years after the school's certification expiration date from this petition cycle.
(v) Recertification denial. SEVP will serve a notice of denial if a school's petition for recertification is denied, in accordance with 8 CFR 103.3(a)(1)(i).
(vi) Adjustment of certification expiration date. Schools eligible for recertification before March 25, 2009 will, at a minimum, have their certification expiration date extended to March 25, 2009. SEVP may extend the certification expiration date beyond this date during the first cycle of recertification.
(3) Out-of-cycle review and oversight of SEVP-certified schools. (i) SEVP will determine if out-of-cycle review is required upon receipt in SEVIS of any changes from an SEVP-certified school to its Form I-17 information. The Form I-17 information that requires out-of-cycle review when changed includes:
(A) Approval for attendance of students (F/M/both);
(B) Name of school system; name of main campus;
(C) Mailing address of the school;
(D) Location of the school;
(E) School type;
(F) Public/private school indicator;
(G) Private school owner name;
(H) The school is engaged in;
(I) The school operates under the following Federal, State, Local or other authorization;
(J) The school has been approved by the following national, regional, or state accrediting association or agency;
(K) Areas of study;
(L) Degrees available from the school;
(M) If the school is engaged in elementary or secondary education;
(N) If the school is engaged in higher education;
(O) If the school is engaged in vocational or technical education;
(P) If the school is engaged in English language training;
(Q) Adding or deleting campuses;
(R) Campus name;
(S) Campus mailing address; and
(T) Campus location address.
(ii) SEVP may request a school to electronically update all Form I-17 fields in SEVIS and provide SEVP with documentation supporting the update. The school must complete such updates in SEVIS and submit the supporting documentation to SEVP within 10 business days of the request from SEVP.
(iii) SEVP may review a school's certification at any time to verify the school's compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of this section to verify the school's continued eligibility for SEVP certification pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section. SEVP may initiate remedial action with the school, as appropriate, and may initiate withdrawal proceedings against the school pursuant to 8 CFR 214.4(b) if noncompliance or ineligibility of a school is identified.
(iv) On-site review. SEVP-certified schools are subject to on-site review at any time. SEVP will initiate withdrawal proceedings against a certified school, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.4(b), if the certified school selected for on-site review prior to its certification expiration date fails to comply with and complete the review within 30 days of the date SEVP contacted the school to arrange the review.
(v) Notice of Continued Eligibility. SEVP will serve the school a notice of continued eligibility if, upon completion of an out-of-cycle review, SEVP determines that the school remains eligible for certification. Such notice will not change the school's previously-determined certification expiration date unless specifically notified by SEVP.
(vi) Withdrawal of certification. SEVP will institute withdrawal proceedings in accordance with 8 CFR 214.4(b) if, upon completion of an out-of-cycle review, SEVP determines that a school or its programs are no longer eligible for certification.
(vii) Voluntary withdrawal. A school can voluntarily withdraw from SEVP certification at any time or in lieu of complying with an out-of-cycle review or request. Failure of a school to comply with an out-of-cycle review or request by SEVP will be treated as a voluntary withdrawal. A school must initiate voluntary withdrawal by sending a request for withdrawal on official school letterhead to SEVP.
(i) Administration of student regulations. DHS officials may conduct out-of-cycle, on-site reviews on the campuses of SEVP-certified schools to determine whether nonimmigrant students on those campuses are complying with DHS regulations pertaining to them, including the requirement that each maintains a valid passport. DHS officers will take appropriate action regarding violations of the regulations by nonimmigrant students.

(j) Advertising. In any advertisement, catalogue, brochure, pamphlet, literature, or other material hereafter printed or reprinted by or for an approved school, any statement which may appear in such material concerning approval for attendance by nonimmigrant students shall be limited solely to the following: This school is authorized under Federal law to enroll nonimmigrant alien students.
(k) Issuance of Certificate of Eligibility. A DSO of an SEVP-certified school must sign any completed Form I-20 issued for either a prospective or continuing student or a dependent. A Form I-20 issued by a certified school system must state which school within the system the student will attend. Only a DSO of an SEVP-certified school may issue a Form I-20 to a prospective student and his or her dependents, and only after the following conditions are met:
(1) The prospective student has made a written application to the school.
(2) The written application, the student's transcripts or other records of courses taken, proof of financial responsibility for the student, and other supporting documents have been received, reviewed, and evaluated at the school's location in the United States.
(3) The appropriate school authority has determined that the prospective student's qualifications meet all standards for admission.
(4) The official responsible for admission at the school has accepted the prospective student for enrollment in a full course of study.
(l) Designated Official. (1) Meaning of term Designated Official. As used in §§214.1(b), 214.2(b), 214.2(f), 214.2(m), and 214.4, a Designated Official, Designated School Official (DSO), or Principal Designated School Official (PDSO), means a regularly employed member of the school administration whose office is located at the school and whose compensation does not come from commissions for recruitment of foreign students. An individual whose principal obligation to the school is to recruit foreign students for compensation does not qualify as a designated official. The PDSO and any other DSO must be named by the president, owner, or head of a school or school system. The PDSO and DSO may not delegate this designation to any other person.
(i) A PDSO and DSO must be either a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States.
(ii) Each campus must have one PDSO. The PDSO is responsible for updating SEVIS to reflect the addition or deletion of any DSO on his or her associated campus. SEVP will use the PDSO as the point of contact on any issues that relate to the school's compliance with the regulations, as well as any system alerts generated by SEVIS. SEVP may also designate certain functions in SEVIS for use by the PDSO only. The PDSO of the main campus is the only DSO authorized to submit a Form I-17 for recertification. The PDSO and DSO will share the same responsibilities in all other respects.
(iii) School officials may nominate as many DSOs in addition to PDSOs as they determine necessary to adequately provide recommendations to F and/or M students enrolled at the school regarding maintenance of nonimmigrant status and to support timely and complete recordkeeping and reporting to DHS, as required by this section. School officials must not permit a DSO or PDSO nominee access to SEVIS until DHS approves the nomination.
(2) Name, title, and sample signature. Petitions for SEVP certification, review and recertification must include the names, titles, and sample signatures of designated officials. An SEVP-certified school must update SEVIS upon any changes to the persons who are principal or designated officials, and furnish the name, title and e-mail address of any new official within 21 days of the change. Any changes to the PDSO or DSO must be made by the PDSO within 21 days of the change. DHS may, at its discretion, reject the submission of any individual as a DSO or withdraw a previous submission by a school of an individual.
(3) Statement of designated officials. A petition for school approval must include a statement by each designated official certifying that the official is familiar with the Service regulations relating to the requirements for admission and maintenance of status of nonimmigrant students, change of nonimmigrant status under part 248 of this chapter, and school approval under §§214.3 and 214.4, and affirming the official's intent to comply with these regulations. At the time a new designated official is added, the designated official must make the same certification.

(a) General—(1) Denial of certification. The petitioning school will be notified of the reasons and appeal rights if a petition for certification is denied, in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 103.3(a)(1)(iii). A petitioning school denied certification may file a new petition for certification at any time.
(2) Denial of recertification or withdrawal on notice. The school must wait at least one calendar year from the date of denial of recertification or withdrawal on notice before being eligible to petition again for SEVP certification if a school's petition for recertification is denied by SEVP pursuant to 8 CFR 214.3(h)(3)(v), or its certification is withdrawn on notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. Eligibility to re-petition will be at the discretion of the Director of SEVP. SEVP certification of a school or school system for the attendance of nonimmigrant students, pursuant to sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) and/or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, will be withdrawn on notice subsequent to out-of-cycle review, or recertification denied, if the school or school system is determined to no longer be entitled to certification for any valid and substantive reason including, but not limited to, the following:
(i) Failure to comply with 8 CFR 214.3(g)(1) without a subpoena.
(ii) Failure to comply with 8 CFR 214.3(g)(2).
(iii) Failure of a DSO to notify SEVP of the attendance of an F-1 transfer student as required by 8 CFR 214.2(f)(8)(ii).
(iv) Failure of a DSO to identify on the Form I-20 which school within the system the student must attend, in compliance with 8 CFR 214.3(k).
(v) Willful issuance by a DSO of a false statement, including wrongful certification of a statement by signature, in connection with a student's school transfer or application for employment or practical training.
(vi) Conduct on the part of a DSO that does not comply with the regulations.
(vii) The designation as a DSO of an individual who does not meet the requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(l)(1).
(viii) Failure to provide SEVP paper copies of the school's Form I-17 bearing the names, titles, and signatures of DSOs as required by 8 CFR 214.3(l)(2).
(ix) Failure to submit statements of DSOs as required by 8 CFR 214.3(l)(3).
(x) Issuance of Forms I-20 to students without receipt of proof that the students have met scholastic, language, or financial requirements as required by 8 CFR 214.3(k)(2).
(xi) Issuance of Forms I-20 to aliens who will not be enrolled in or carry full courses of study, as defined in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6) or 214.2(m)(9).
(xii) Failure to operate as a bona fide institution of learning.
(xiii) Failure to employ adequate qualified professional personnel.
(xiv) Failure to limit advertising in the manner prescribed in 8 CFR 214.3(j).
(xv) Failure to maintain proper facilities for instruction.
(xvi) Failure to maintain accreditation or licensing necessary to qualify graduates as represented in the school's Form I-17.
(xvii) Failure to maintain the physical plant, curriculum, and teaching staff in the manner represented in the Form I-17.
(xviii) Failure to comply with the procedures for issuance of Forms I-20 as set forth in 8 CFR 214.3(k).
(xix) Failure of a DSO to notify SEVP of material changes, such as changes to the school's name, address, or curricular changes that represent material change to the scope of institution offerings (e.g., addition of a program, class or course for which the school is issuing Forms I-20, but which does not have Form I-17 approval), as required by 8 CFR 214.3(f)(1).
(3) Automatic withdrawal. A school that is automatically withdrawn and subsequently wishes to enroll nonimmigrant students in the future may file a new petition for SEVP certification at any time. The school must use the certification petition procedures described in 8 CFR 214.3(h)(1) to gain access to SEVIS for submitting its petition. Past compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l), and with the requirements for transition of students under paragraph (i) of this section will be considered in the evaluation of a school's subsequent petition for certification. SEVP certification will be automatically withdrawn:
(i) As of the date of termination of operations, if an SEVP-certified school terminates its operations.
(ii) As of a school's certification expiration date, if an SEVP-certified school does not submit a completed recertification petition in the manner required by 8 CFR 214.3(h)(2).
(iii) Sixty days after the change of ownership if an SEVP-certified school changes ownership, unless the school files a new petition for SEVP certification, in accordance with the procedures at 8 CFR 214.3(h)(1), within 60 days of the change of ownership. SEVP will review the petition if the school properly files such petition to determine whether the school still meets the eligibility requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(a)(3) and is still in compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l). SEVP will institute withdrawal proceedings in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section if, upon completion of the review, SEVP finds that the school is no longer eligible for certification, or is not in compliance with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l).
(iv) If an SEVP-certified school voluntarily withdraws from its certification.
(4) Automatic withdrawal as of SEVIS mandatory compliance date. The present approval of any school that has not filed for enrollment in SEVIS by the mandatory compliance date for attendance of nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act is automatically withdrawn as of the day following the mandatory compliance date for SEVIS. Given the time necessary to conduct a review of each school, the Service will review and adjudicate Form I-17 petitions for approval in SEVIS prior to the SEVIS mandatory compliance date only for Form I-17 petitions filed at least 75 days prior to this mandatory date. If a Form I-17 petition is filed less than 75 days prior to the mandatory compliance date and is not adjudicated prior to the mandatory compliance date, the school will not be authorized to access SEVIS and will be unable to issue any SEVIS Forms I-20 until the adjudication is complete.
(b) Withdrawal on notice. SEVP will initiate an out-of-cycle review and serve the school with an NOIW if SEVP has information that a school or school system may no longer be entitled to SEVP certification prior to the school being due for its two-year recertification. The NOIW will inform the school of:
(1) The grounds for withdrawing SEVP certification.
(2) The 30-day deadline from the date of the service of the NOIW for the school to submit sworn statements, and documentary or other evidence, to rebut the grounds for withdrawal of certification in the NOIW. An NOIW is not a means for the school to submit evidence that it should have previously submitted as a part of its established reporting requirements.
(3) The school's right to submit a written request (including e-mail) within 30 days of the date of service of the NOIW for a telephonic interview in support of its response to the NOIW.
(c) Assistance of counsel. The school or school system shall also be informed in the notice of intent to withdraw approval that it may be assisted or represented by counsel of its choice qualified under part 292 of this chapter, at no expense to the Government, in preparation of its answer or in connection with the interview.
(d) Allegations admitted or no answer filed. If the school or school system admits all of the allegations in the notice of intent to withdraw approval, or if the school or school system fails to file an answer within the 30-day period, the district director shall withdraw the approval previously granted and he/she shall notify the designated school official of the decision. No appeal shall lie from the district director's decision if all allegations are admitted or no answer is filed within the 30-day period.
(e) Allegations denied. If the school or school system denies the allegations in the notice of intent to withdraw approval, then the school or school system shall, in its answer, provide all information or evidence on which the answer is based.
(f) Interview requested. (1) If in its answer to the notice of intent to withdraw approval the school or school system requests an interview, the school or school system shall be given notice of the date set for the interview.
(2) A summary of the information provided by the school or school system at the interview shall be prepared and included in the record. In the discretion of the district director, the interview may be recorded.
(g) Decision. The decision of SEVP will be in accordance with 8 CFR 103.3(a)(1).
(h) Appeals. Notices of denial or withdrawal of SEVP certification will include appeal alternatives and filing instructions. Any appeal must be taken within 15 days after the service of the decision by stating the reasons for the appeal in the notice of appeal provided with the instructions, and supported by a statement or brief specifically setting forth the grounds for contesting the withdrawal of the approval. No fee is required with appeals related to denial of SEVP recertification or withdrawal of SEVP certification.
(i) Operations at a school when SEVP certification is relinquished or withdrawn, or whose recertification is denied and on the SEVIS access termination date—(1) General. A school whose certification is relinquished or withdrawn, or whose recertification is denied may, at SEVP discretion, no longer be able to create Initial student records or issue new Forms I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student, for initial attendance. Schools must comply with the instructions given in the notice of withdrawal or denial with regard to management of status for their Initial and continuing F and/or M students. All other SEVIS functionality, including event reporting for students, will remain unchanged until the school's SEVIS access termination date. The school must continue to comply with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements of 8 CFR 214.3(f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) until its SEVIS access termination date.
(2) SEVIS access termination. In determining the SEVIS access termination date, SEVP will consider the impact that such date will have upon SEVP, the school, and the school's nonimmigrant students in determining the SEVIS access termination date. In most situations, SEVP will not determine a SEVIS access termination date for that school until the appeals process has concluded and the initial denial or withdrawal has been upheld unless a school whose certification is withdrawn or whose recertification is denied is suspected of criminal activity or poses a potential national security threat. The school will no longer be able to access SEVIS, and SEVP will automatically terminate any remaining Active SEVIS records for that school on the SEVIS access termination date.
(3) Legal obligations and ramifications for a school and its DSOs when a school is having SEVP certification denied or withdrawn. Schools are obligated to their students to provide the programs of study to which they have committed themselves in the students' application for enrollment and acceptance process. Schools are obligated to the U.S. government to comply with the recordkeeping, retention, reporting and other requirements contained in 8 CFR 214.3. With any new petition for SEVP certification, SEVP will consider the extent to which a school has fulfilled these obligations to students and the U.S. government during any previous period of SEVP certification.

(2) An alien who is exempt from the visa requirement described in section 212(d)(4) of the Act must pay the fee to DHS before the alien applies for admission at a U.S. port-of-entry to begin initial attendance at a DHS-approved school or initial participation in a Department of State-designated exchange visitor program.
(3) A nonimmigrant alien in the United States seeking a change of status to F-1, F-3, J-1, M-1, or M-3 must pay the fee to DHS before the alien is granted the change of nonimmigrant status, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.

(e) Circumstances where no new fee is required.
(1) Extension of stay, transfer, or optional practical training for students. An F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 nonimmigrant is not required to pay a new fee in connection with:
(i) An application for an extension of stay, as provided in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(7) or (m)(10);

(i) No fee is required for changes between the F-1 and F-3 classifications, and no fee is required for changes between the M-1 and M-3 classifications.
(ii) Institutional reclassification. DHS retains the discretionary authority to waive the additional fee requirement when a nonimmigrant changes classification between F and M, if the change of status is due solely to institutional reclassification by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program during that nonimmigrant's course of study.
(5) Re-application following denial of application by consular officer. An alien who fully paid a SEVIS fee in connection with an initial application for an F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 visa, or a J-1 visa in a particular program category, whose initial application was denied, and who is reapplying for the same status, or the same J-1 exchange visitor category, within 12 months following the initial notice of denial is not required to repay the SEVIS fee.
(6) Re-application following denial of an application for a change of status. A nonimmigrant who fully paid a SEVIS fee in connection with an initial application for a change of status within in the United States to F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 classification, or for a change of status to a particular J-1 exchange visitor category, whose initial application was denied, and who is granted a motion to reopen the denied case is not required to repay the SEVIS fee if the motion to reopen is granted within 12 months of receipt of initial notice of denial.
(f) [Reserved]
(g) Procedures for payment of the SEVIS fee. (1) Options for payment. An alien subject to payment of a fee under this section may pay the fee by any procedure approved by DHS, including:
(2) Receipts. DHS will provide a receipt for each fee payment under paragraph (g)(1) of this section until such time as DHS issues a notice in the Federal Register that paper receipts will no longer be necessary. Further receipt provisions include:
(3) Electronic record of fee payment. DHS will maintain an electronic record of payment for the alien as verification of receipt of the required fee under this section. If DHS records indicate that the fee has been paid, an alien who has lost or did not receive a receipt for a fee payment under this section will not be denied an immigration benefit, including visa issuance or admission to the United States, solely because of a failure to present a paper receipt of fee payment.
(4) Third-party payments. DHS will accept payment of the required fee for an alien from an approved school or a designated exchange visitor program sponsor, or from another source, in accordance with procedures approved by DHS.
(h) Failure to pay the fee. The failure to pay the required fee is grounds for denial of F, M, or J nonimmigrant status or status-related benefits. Payment of the fee does not preserve the lawful status of any F, J, or M nonimmigrant that has violated his or her status in some other manner.

Apply For Your U.S. Student Visa: Undergraduate,"
Jump to navigation

The United States government offers three student visa types including F, J, and M.
Before you can apply for an F, J, or M student visa, you must first apply and be accepted by a U.S. institution of higher education that is certified by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP).
Even when an institution is SEVP-certified and able to issue I-20 and DS-2019 forms for use in visa applications, it may not hold national or regional accreditation. The U.S. Department of Education and Council for Higher Education Accreditation databases list accreditation status for all U.S. institutions. Institutions designated by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to place participants in Academic Exchange programs (J visas) must be accredited. Recognition of course credits and degrees by other institutions and by U.S. and international employers is linked to an institution's accreditation. To learn more about accreditation talk to an EducationUSA Adviser in person or online.
Once accepted at an SEVP-certified school, you will receive a Form I-20 or DS-2019 from the institution's international student office to present when you apply for your student visa. Once you receive your form, visit:
1. U.S. Department of State - Consular Affairs (Student Visas)
2. U.S. Department of State - U.S. Embassies and Consulates
3. U.S. Department of Homeland Security - Study in the States
It is important to note that two separate U.S. government agencies are involved with international student arrival and status while studying in the United States. The State Department is responsible for the visa application process and issuing the visa. Once a visa holder arrives in the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then takes over as the responsible agency for entry into the country, as well as issuing and enforcing international student regulations. Please read information from all three sources above before applying for a U.S. student visa. The sites address employment, maintaining your status, and other vital topics.

"F-1 Visas for International Students: Requirements, Rules ...","Get ready to study abroad in America with our step-by-step guide to F-1 visa rules. 
Students wishing to study in the United States need to learn about the F-1 student visa application process. There are more than one million international students currently studying abroad in the USA, and with some preparation and guidance, you can join them. To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. The I-20 form provided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with your F-1 visa after graduation.
Have questions about the student visa process? Attend an upcoming Shorelight webinar > 
There are several F-1 visa rules to keep in mind if you plan to apply for a F-1 student visa. You must meet these requirements for your application to be accepted:
Institution certification—The college or the university where you plan to study needs to be approved by SEVP Immigration & Customs Enforcement.
Full-time enrollment—You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution while your academic term is in session.
English language proficiency—You must meet the required English language proficiency score of the institution you are attending or be enrolled in courses that will help you improve your English proficiency.
Sufficient funding—You must prove you have sufficient funds available to finance your studies and living expenses while in the US.
Valid passport—Your passport should be valid for US travel for at least six months after your program completion date.
Home country residency—You are required to have a residence in your home country to return to following the completion of your degree.

Before you begin your F-1 visa application, you must take the following steps:
Get accepted by a SEVP-certified institution before submitting your visa application. When you are accepted, you will receive your I-20 form, which you will need to apply for your F-1 visa.
Pay your SEVIS fee.
Complete your DS-160 visa application.
Schedule your visa interview.
Attend your visa interview.
If you are applying for a F-1 visa from India, Shorelight’s F-1 visa for Indian students guide is for you.
Once these steps are completed, you will be ready to complete and submit your F-1 student visa application. 
1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US government’s way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education. 
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay. 
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials. 
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., like getting a US driver’s license). 
Helpful resources: Confirm your US university is a SEVP-accredited institution 
Keep your Shorelight enrollment advisor updated through every step of the visa process – when you submit your application, schedule your visa interview, and, of course, when your visa application is approved.
2. Pay Your SEVIS Fee
The total cost for your F-1 student visa will be approximately $510, which includes the cost of the visa itself, plus SEVIS processing and maintenance fees. 
Requirements: Your I-20
Cost: $350 
Where to apply: Payment portal for your SEVIS fee
Make sure to save the I-901 SEVIS fee receipt. You will need it for your visa interview. 
3. Complete Your DS-160 Visa Application
Your DS-160 is your visa application. All prospective international students must complete a DS-160 to receive an F-1 visa. 
Requirements: Your I-20, passport, travel itinerary, photo for your visa
Cost: $160 
Where to apply: Application portal for your DS-160
After you successfully submit your DS-160, you will receive a printed confirmation with a barcode on it. Save this form – you will need it for your visa interview. 
4. Schedule Your Visa Interview
Find the nearest US embassy or consulate and schedule your visa interview. Wait times will vary by country and can take months — so remember to set up your appointments as early as possible!
If you are enrolling at a US university through Shorelight, ask your enrollment advisor about student visa interview tips or how to set up a mock interview session. Practicing your visa interview in advance will make you feel more comfortable with the process.
Ask your Shorelight advisor to set up a mock visa interview for you.
5. Attend Your Visa Interview
During the interview portion of the F-1 visa application process, the US consulate or embassy confirms you are coming to study as a legitimate, serious student. In your visa interview, you must also prove you have the funds to cover your time studying in the US, and confirm that you plan on returning home after your studies are complete. Attending your visa interview in person is required, though there are a few rare exceptions (e.g., if you are younger than 14 or older than 80 years of age, or if you meet certain visa renewal requirements). 
Cost: Your DS-160 payment covers the cost
Where to apply: Scheduling portal for your visa interview
After you successfully complete your visa interview, you will be granted your F-1 visa and acquire F-1 status. You are now cleared to study in the USA! 
Refer to Travel.state.gov to learn more. If you need any help with preparing or submitting your application, Shorelight provides application assistance for international students.
Before you attend your visa interview, make sure to have the following documents ready for evaluation by the consular officer:
A valid passport
A copy of the photo you will use for your visa
Printed copies of your DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmations
I-20 form
School transcript and official test scores cited on your university application
Diploma (if applicable)
Bank statements or other proof of finances
During your interview, the consular officer may request additional documents. To prepare, consider bringing the following documents:
Academic records such as transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates from schools you attended
Standardized test scores required by your US institution
Evidence of your intent to depart the United States upon completion of your course of study
Statements proving your ability to pay all educational, living, and travel costs
As an international student, you might feel uncertain about your upcoming interview. While feeling nervous is normal, do not forget to take a deep breath and remember that you are well prepared! Your interview is important, but should not be stressful.
Your interviewer will ask questions to determine: 
Are you a legitimate student?
Do you have the resources to pay for your studies?
Do you plan to return home after completing your degree?
To prepare for your F-1 student visa interview, here are some questions you might be asked: 
Why did you pick this university?
Which other US universities did you apply to?
How will you pay for your education?
Do you have relatives in the USA?
Do you plan to work while in the USA?
What do you plan to do after graduation?
Your Shorelight advisor can help you prepare for your interview by giving you a detailed overview of what the process will involve. They can also help you practice with mock interviews! Shorelight’s F-1 student visa interview guide can also help you learn more about what you can do to prepare for your upcoming interview. 
There is a possibility that your F-1 visa application will be denied. If this happens, you will be given detailed reasoning in writing, including the section of the law that led to the denial of your application.  
To avoid having your F-1 student visa application denied, it is important to read and follow all instructions carefully. Always double- and triple-check your documents before submitting your application. Shorelight advisors can offer visa assistance to make this process easier for you: They are happy to help you organize all the documents you will need, in the correct formats, and on schedule. 
Remember: During your F-1 student visa interview, you want to sufficiently demonstrate that you are traveling to the US to study and planning to return to your home country once your program is complete. Keep this in mind as you answer your interview questions.
As an international student, you must actively maintain your F-1 status to continue studying in the US. To do this, you must comply with both university regulations and codes of conduct, as well as with the requirements and conditions set out in your F-1 visa requirements. 
When entering the US:
Make sure to enter the US no more than 30 days before your program begins.
As soon as you arrive in the country, contact your designated school official (DSO).
When you arrive at your university, contact your DSO again before the start date listed on your I-20 form.
While studying in the US:
Attend all your classes and maintain good academic standing. If you require support with any of your classes, your Shorelight advisor can direct you to academic resources to help you improve.
If you need extra time to complete your program which would exceed the end date specified in your I-20, speak with your DSO to discuss your options for possible extensions.
Make sure to enroll for a full course of study when your academic term is in session.
If you want to drop a class or change classes, make sure to speak to your DSO first.
If you want to take a break and/or go on vacation, remember to first complete at least one full academic year at your institution.  After your holiday, you must also register for classes in the next academic term.
Yes, you will be able to work in the US on a F-1 student visa. However, you will have to follow certain F-1 visa rules and restrictions:
You can only work part time on campus while your academic term is in session
You can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week
You may be able to work off campus with the approval of your university
During academic breaks, you will be permitted to work full time, if your university allows it. You can learn more about working as a F-1 international student by referring to USCIS.gov.
When searching for work while you study, make sure to seek approval from your DSO first. 
Keep in mind, once you finish your program, you will have a grace period of 60 days to leave the US. If you wish to extend your stay, you can speak to a Shorelight advisor to explore your options, such as transferring to another school or pursuing further education. You can also refer to Shorelight’s F-1 extension guide to have a look at your options.
Now that you know how US non-immigrant visas work for international students, create a checklist of next steps and get started. The sooner you begin fulfilling the USA study visa requirements, the better chance you will have of securing your spot at an American university.

Congratulations on your decision to study in the United States. Nonimmigrant students who come to the United States to study must follow specific rules. However, different rules apply depending on your student type and education level. Learn what student type and education level applies to you below:
Student Type:
Education Level:

Your first step is to apply to a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school in the United States. Use the School Search tool to find SEVP-certified schools and programs that are eligible to enroll F-1 and M-1 students. For more information about the types of programs that are available to you, please visit EducationUSA.
If you are a student currently enrolled in the equivalent of a kindergarten through grade 12 program, visit the Kindergarten to Grade 12 page on Study in the States.
The Form I-20
Once you are accepted into an SEVP-certified school, your school’s designated school official will send you a document called the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” The Form I-20 is a paper record of your information in our Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) database. Each school that accepts you will mail you a Form I-20.
For more information, visit the Students and the Form I-20 page.
After receiving your Form I-20, you must pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee.
Federal regulations require all F, M and J students pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee before applying for their U.S. student visa. You can pay your I-901 SEVIS Fee online at FMJfee.com or by using Western Union Quick Pay. You must present the receipt as proof of payment when you apply for visa. It’s important that the SEVIS ID number on your I-901 SEVIS Fee receipt matches your SEVIS ID number on your Form I-20. If it does not, or you encounter other issues paying your fee, please contact SEVP.
I-901 SEVIS Fee Assistance:
Learn more about the I-901 SEVIS Fee:
After paying the I-901 SEVIS Fee and getting a receipt, you must apply for a visa at any U.S. Embassy or Consulate before you come to the United States.
To receive a visa, you will have to participate in an in-person interview. During your visa interview, you will need to establish that you meet the requirements under U.S. law to receive the category of visa for which you are applying. The consular officer will determine if you qualify to receive a visa and which visa category is appropriate based on your purpose of travel.
A visa does not guarantee entrance to the United States; it only permits you to arrive and seek permission to enter the country. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the U.S. port of entry has the final authority to admit entry into the country.
The following pages will assist with this process:
Before you leave for the United States, familiarize yourself with the different documents you will need or could need when you arrive. It is also a good idea to make at least two sets of copies of these documents: one copy to leave with your family before you depart and one copy to give to your school officials. Required documents include your:
It is also smart to have your acceptance letter, proof of financial ability and any other supporting documentation with you, in case the Customs and Border Protection officer asks for them. You should carry your original travel documents on you at all times while traveling. Do not put them in your checked baggage. For more information on traveling to the United States, visit the Getting to the United States page.
When you arrive to the United States you will meet a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry, who will verify your information and determine if you may enter the country.
If the officer cannot initially verify your information, or if you do not have all of the required documentation, you may be directed to an interview area known as “secondary inspection.” Secondary inspection allows inspectors to conduct additional research in order to verify information without causing delays for other arriving passengers.
The inspector will first attempt to verify your status by using SEVIS. In the event that the CBP officer needs to verify information with your school or program, we strongly recommend that you have the name and telephone number of the designated school official (DSO) at your school on hand. If you arrive during non-business hours (evening, weekends, holidays), you should also have an emergency or non-business hour phone number available for this official.
Failure to comply with U.S. government entry-exit procedures may result in your being denied entry to the United States. Under certain circumstances, the CBP officer may issue a Form I-515A, “Notice to Student or Exchange Visitor,” which authorizes temporary admission into the United States. Work with your school without delay to submit the proper documentation required by the Form I-515A. Failing to comply with a Form I-515A will result in the termination of your status. Read SEVP’s Form I-515A Noncompliance Termination procedure to ensure you understand how to properly respond and maintain your status.
If the CBP officer admits you into the country, you will be given a Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record.” This form shows that you have been legally admitted into the United States, the class of admission and your authorized period of stay. It is very important that the information on the record is correct. Inconsistencies between the information on the Form I-94 and SEVIS records can reduce the chances of a successful systems interface and can result in denial of benefits or difficulty re-entering the country.
You have 30 days to enter the country before your official program start date, as listed on your Form I-20. If you do not report to your school by your program start date, your DSO may terminate your SEVIS record. We suggest that you contact your school immediately once you enter the country so that there is no question of your arrival.
If you cannot enter the United States for the term listed on your Form I-20, contact your school officials as soon as possible so that they can update your record so your plans are accurately reflected in SEVIS.
As an F or M student, you will often hear the phrase “maintaining status.” Maintaining your status means that you are fulfilling the purpose for why the U.S. Department of State issued you your visa and following the regulations associated with that purpose. Remember, a student visa is a travel document you receive from a U.S. consulate or embassy before you enter the United States. Your student status is what you must maintain after you are granted entrance into the United States. Learn more about the rules you must follow by talking to your DSO and reviewing the Maintaining Status page on Study in the States.
While studying in the United States, you may be eligible to apply for certain benefits. These student benefits are not granted by SEVP and require students to apply to other government agencies to receive them. The benefits you are eligible for will depend on your student status. Visit the following pages to learn more about potential student benefits:
As a note, most employment and training opportunities require authorization from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). For more information, visit the Employment page on ICE.gov.
If you are having an immediate problem and need assistance quickly, please speak with your DSO or responsible officer. If that person cannot help you, contact the SEVP Response Center at 1-703-603-3400 or at SEVP@ice.dhs.gov.
Once you have completed your program and fulfilled your purpose for coming to the United States, you may have a number of options. These include changing your status, applying for training, transferring to another SEVP-certified school or leaving the country.
Please note there are restrictions that apply to M-1 students regarding transferring and changing status. Talk to your DSO to understand what your options are.
If after your program is complete you do not qualify to stay in the country, or chose to depart, please be advised:
You can also visit USCIS to learn about naturalization and the path to U.S. citizenship.

While studying in the United States, it is important to maintain your F or M student status. Your status relates to the purpose, or reason for why you want to come to the United States. The U.S. Department of State issues you your visa based on your intended purpose. 
If the Department of State issues you an F or M student visa, this means that you are coming to the United States to study. You should not take any action that detracts from that purpose. Maintaining your status means:
Fulfilling the purpose for why the Department of State issued you your visa.
Following the regulations associated with that purpose.
F-1 and M-1 students share the same primary purpose for coming to the United States however, F-1 students enroll in more traditional academic programs, while M-1 students enroll in vocational programs. Because these two types of programs are different in nature, the types of benefits an international student may be eligible for and how long they may remain in the country depend on whether they are an F-1 or M-1 student.  Learn more about these specific differences by reviewing the F&M Student Status: Know the Difference infographic.
Below are actions to take in order to properly maintain your status.
When arriving to the United States, both F and M students must:
Enter the United States no more than 30 days before your program of study begins.
Immediately contact your designated school official (DSO) when you enter the United States.
When you arrive at school, you need to contact your DSO again, no later than the program start date listed on your Form I-20, ""Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.""
While studying in the United States, both F and M students must:
F-1 students must complete at least one full academic year at an SEVP-certified school to be eligible for annual vacation. Additionally, students must intend to register for classes in the academic term following their annual vacation.
SEVP-certified schools should have clear and consistent policies regarding annual vacation and comply with the requirements laid out in SEVP Policy Guidance for Adjudicators 1408-01: Academic Year.
Please note that during an annual vacation, students can take as many, as few or no courses as they want. SEVP considers all study during an annual vacation incident to status.
An F student may only work when authorized by a DSO in some cases, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in others. If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately, and you may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date. 
F students are also eligible for optional practical training during or following the program of study. OPT is a form of temporary employment that directly relates to your program of study. 
For more information about employment and training options available for F-students, visit the Working in the United States page and talk with your DSO.
M-1 students are not eligible for employment during their program of study, but may obtain authorization for practical training employment. You may participate in practical training employment after the completion of your vocational program. 
If you want to participate in practical training employment in the United States, talk with your DSO about your options. Practical training employment requires your DSO’s recommendation and authorization from USCIS. 
If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately. You may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date.
F and M students must take action to maintain legal status or depart the United States after completing your program of study.
Once you complete your program of study and any authorized period of practical training, F students have 60 days after completion of your program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. If you wish to extend your stay in the United States, talk with your DSO to learn more about doing one of the following:
Transfer to another school.
Change your education level (e.g. bachelor’s to master’s).
Apply to change status  to another visa status (e.g. H-1B-temporary worker; O-extraordinary ability in science, art or business; P-athlete).
M students have 30 days after completion of their program (the program end date on your Form I-20) to leave the United States. The latest date you may remain in the United States is the “admit until” date on your Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record,” unless you filed for an extension with USCIS.
If you are an F or M student studying in the United States, your DSO should be the first person you talk with if you have any questions regarding the legal requirements of your stay in the United States. Your DSO can assist in answering your questions or help you find someone who can help.
M-1 students should speak with their DSO if they are planning to do any of the following:
Take a break from school.
Travel outside the United States.
Move to a new address.
Request a program extension.
Both F and M students may contact SEVP by email at sevp@ice.dhs.gov if your DSO is unable to assist you or if you would prefer to ask someone else.
In your email, please describe your situation and include any questions you have. SEVP provides responses on a first-come, first-served basis. Answer times may vary depending on the current number of inquiries.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.
There are several steps to apply for a visa. The order of these steps and how you complete them may vary by U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Please consult the instructions on the embassy or consulate website.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.
While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa.  However, once you depart the United States you must apply for a new visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.

There is no guarantee you will be issued a visa. Do not make final travel plans or buy tickets until you have a visa.
For information about working in the United States during your study, review Students and Employment and Form I-765 Work Authorization Instructions on the USCIS website.
If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

F-1 Students - International Student Services,"On This Page:
It is your responsibility to understand and comply with the terms of your immigration status during your stay in the United States. A violation of the immigration regulations (for example, failure to maintain a full-time credit load or unauthorized employment) could jeopardize your F-1 status and legal stay in the U.S. Review this information carefully and contact ISS if you have questions.
“Status” is your nonresident category officially granted by an immigration official. To be in F-1 “status” means that you are legally in the U.S. and have benefits and restrictions specified in the immigration regulations for the F-1 visa category. You gain F-1 status either by entering the U.S. with F-1 documents or, for people already in the U.S. in a different status, by applying to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for a change of status.
Your admission to the U.S. is for “duration of status,” meaning the length of your F-1 status.
F-1 status covers the period when:
Your length of authorized stay within the U.S. is not related to your F-1 visa expiration date. Your length of authorized stay depends on you following the F-1 rules.
Federal law requires you to carry “registration documents” at all times, including your I-20 and passport. We suggest that these documents be kept in a secure location such as a bank safe deposit box, and you should carry photocopies. However, if you are traveling outside the Seattle area you should carry the original documents with you. If you are traveling by air, train, bus, or ship, you may be required to produce these documents before boarding. Keep photocopies of all your documents in a separate location in the event your documents are lost or stolen.
Your passport must be valid at all times. Keep your passport and other important documents in a safe place, such as a bank safe deposit box. Report a lost or stolen passport to the police because your government may require a police report before issuing a new passport. To renew or replace your passport, contact your country’s consulate in the U.S.
The visa is the stamp that the U.S. consular officer places on a page in your passport. The visa permits you to apply for admission into the U.S. as an F-1 student, and does not need to remain valid while you are in the U.S. The F-1 visa is specifically for entry into the U.S. After you are in the U.S., the F-1 visa might expire before your status expires, or your status might end before your visa expires.
If your visa expires while you are in the U.S., the next time you travel abroad you must obtain a new F-1 visa before returning to the U.S. Visas can only be obtained outside of the U.S. at a U.S. consulate. Exceptions to this rule exist for short trips to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands. For more information, visit the Travel and Visas section.
Issued by UW, this document allows you to apply for an F-1 visa if you are outside the U.S., apply for F-1 status within the U.S., enter and reenter the U.S. in F-1 status, and prove your eligibility for various F-1 benefits. The I-20 indicates the institution in which you are permitted to study, your program of study, and the dates of eligibility. The I-20 must remain valid at all times. Allowing the I-20 to expire before you complete your academic program is a violation of F-1 status.
The I-20 is a printout from your Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record.
The I-94 is the record of your entry to the U.S. Most I-94 records are now electronic and can be accessed online.
You might need a printout of your electronic I-94 information to apply for various benefits such as a Washington State ID card or a Social Security Number. You can obtain a printout of your I-94 record on the I-94 Website.
Many kinds of updates must be reported to the Department of Homeland Security through SEVIS and must be changed on your I-20. Notify ISS of the following changes and request an updated I-20. Keep every I-20 for your permanent record, even after you graduate. Do not discard the old ones, even from previous schools. ISS files are archived and destroyed after several years, so it is your responsibility to keep your I-20s in case you need them to apply for future immigration benefits.
If you are unable to complete your course of study before the completion date noted in item 5 on your I-20, you must request an extended I-20 before your current I-20 expires. For more information and instructions, review Program Extension information.
You must register full-time at the UW since the UW issued your I-20 and oversees your SEVIS record. If you decide to transfer to another school, contact ISS prior to completing your final quarter at UW. For information about transferring your SEVIS record to the new school, visit School Transfer.
If you will complete your current program of study and plan to continue at the University of Washington in another program (for example, change from a Master’s degree program to a Ph.D. program), your I-20 must be updated. For more information, review Change of Level information.
If you are accepted into a major or if you change your major (for example, pre-major to History or History to Biology), you will be issued a new I-20.
If there is a substantial change in the source or amount of your funding, report this change to ISS and a new I-20 will be issued to you. For example, if you receive a Research or Teaching Assistantship through your department, but your I-20 indicates that you use personal funds to pay for expenses, you should request a new I-20. For more information, review Change of Funding information.
The name on your I-20 should match the name on your passport. If you change any part of your legal name—first/given name, middle name, or last/family name—on your passport, this change should be reflected on your I-20. Conversely, if you want a different name on your I-20, ISS will wait for you to change your passport first, before updating the I-20. Note that SEVIS is a separate database from the UW database. For instructions on changing your name in the UW database, visit: Name Change Policy.
In general, F-1 students must be registered full-time. This is defined as at least:
Only one online class may count towards the minimum credit amount each quarter.
Do not register for fewer than the required number of credits or withdraw from a course without first receiving permission from ISS. Part-time studies could jeopardize your stay in the U.S. and make you ineligible for F-1 benefits.
For more information and exceptions to full-time enrollment, review the Full-Time Enrollment and Exceptions information.
To maintain status, an F-1 student is also required to “make normal progress.” Making normal progress includes, but is not limited to, enrolling in the proper courses required for degree completion, maintaining satisfactory academic progress, and continually meeting all institutional enrollment requirements.
“Employment” is any work performed or services provided (including self-employment) in exchange for money or other benefit or compensation (for example, free room and board in exchange for babysitting). Unauthorized employment is taken very seriously by U.S. immigration officials; familiarize yourself with your F-1 employment eligibility options and always contact ISS before accepting any work that you are not sure is authorized.
Your spouse and unmarried children under 21 may be eligible for F-2 dependent status. Contact ISS for procedures to invite a dependent to join you in the U.S. Immigration regulations do not permit F-2 dependents to be employed in the U.S. F-2 dependents can study part-time in an academic or vocational curriculum at a SEVP-certified school. F-2 dependents can also study in avocational or recreational programs–hobbies. F-2 dependents may enroll full-time in kindergarten through 12th grade.
An F-2 dependent who wants to pursue full-time study must obtain F-1 status to begin the full-time program.
For more information on adding an F-2 dependent, review the Spouses and Children webpage.
Any change of address must be reported to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) within 10 days. Update your local address through your MyUW account, and DHS will automatically be notified of the change. If you are on OPT, submit your address change through your MyISSS portal. Please note that your local US address must be your physical address, not a P.O. Box. To update your permanent foreign address, which must be a non-U.S. address, please submit a request through MyISSS.
The end of your academic program affects your F-1 status. After you graduate or complete your program, you have a 60-day grace period.
Review the ISS Final Quarter Checklist for more information on your options during your grace period, including eligibility for work authorization, travel, commencement, inviting family members to visit the U.S., and other related issues.
If you do not complete your educational objective (for example, if you withdraw from your program), you are not eligible for the 60-day grace period. Contact your ISS adviser in this situation.
If you violate the immigration regulations you will lose your F-1 status.
However, students may be able to regain valid F-1 status either through a reinstatement application to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services or through travel and reentry with a new I-20/new SEVIS record. The appropriate option will depend on your individual circumstances; review the reinstatement and reentry procedures and consult your ISS adviser as soon as possible for more information. A scheduled appointment with your ISS adviser is required because drop-in advising will not allow sufficient time to discuss this topic. In addition, we strongly recommend that students in this situation consult with an experienced immigration attorney.

A student visa is a travel document you receive from a U.S. consulate or embassy before you enter the United States. Your student status is what you must maintain after you are granted entrance into the United States.
Both your visa and status reflect your primary purpose for coming to the United States. As an F-1 or M-1 student, this purpose is to complete a full course of study at a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school.
U.S. consulates and embassies issue visas, and the type of student visa you receive depends on your course of study and the SEVP-certified school you attend.
However, a student visa does not guarantee entrance into the country. You must present your visa and other travel documents to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at a U.S. port of entry. A CBP officer may interview you further to determine whether or not you may enter the United States.
If you are permitted to enter the United States, the CBP officer will provide you with an admission stamp in your passport or a paper Form I-94, ""Arrival and Departure Record."" The Form I-94 includes information about when you were admitted and how long you can stay in the United States. For more information about the Form I-94 and the arrival process in the United States, visit the CBP website.
Once you are admitted into the United States, your visa may expire. However, you may remain in the country until the departure date that CBP stamped on your passport or Form I-94 as long as you maintain your status. Maintaining your status means that you perform certain actions and follow rules that help you fulfill your purpose for coming to the United States.
For an F-1 student, you will likely be admitted to the United States for a “duration of status.” This means you can stay until 60 days after your program or optional practical training end date, which is listed on your Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.”

F-1 vs. J-1: Which Status is Right For You?,"Students seeking services can see our current student services page, which includes virtual and in-person options. For J scholar and Employment-based services, please see our Contact Us page.
Welcome international students! Look for the relevant section for information and resources from BIO to make your studies at Cal a success. 
Information for visiting international professors and researchers.
Berkeley International Office's mission is to enhance the academic experiences of international students and scholars by providing the highest levels of knowledge and expertise in advising, immigration services, advocacy, and programming to the UC Berkeley campus community.
F-1 is the most common visa status used by students in the U.S. and best fits a student's situation. Most international students at UC Berkeley have F-1 status. See F-1 Immigration Regulations to find out more about the benefits and restrictions of F-1 status.
J-1 visa status is generally used for students in specific educational exchange programs such as the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP), Fulbright, LASPAU, DAAD, AmidEast, or others. It may also be used by the university for students in degree programs. To be eligible for a J-1, students must receive a majority of their financial support from sources other than personal funds. The U.S. Department of State also requires specific health insurance coverage for J-1 students and accompanying J-2 dependents for the entirety of their stay in the U.S. See J-1 Immigration Matters to learn more about the benefits and restrictions of the J-1 student status. 
To be eligible for J-1 status, students must meet the following criteria:
Any source of financial support is acceptable.
Must show financial support for the first year of the program when requesting the initial I-20 document.
During F-1 student's degree program, Curricular Practical Training permission is available for off campus jobs/internships related to the major field of study.
Post-completion Optional Practical Training employment permission is available for a 12-month period. A job offer is not required to apply for 12-Month OPT.
An OPT extension for an additional 24 months is possible for certain STEM majors.
J-2 dependent (spouse, child) work permission is available, but not guaranteed. Income from the dependent's employment may be used to support the family's customary recreational and cultural activities and related travel, among other things. Employment will not be authorized if this income is needed to support the J-1 primary status holder. 
J-1 and J-2 dependents may be subject to the Two-Year Home Country Physical Presence Requirement
J-1 and J-2 dependents may also be subject to the 12-Month Bar depending on the length of the J program.
Note that the Two-Year Home Country Physical Presence Requirement and 12-Month Bar are separate rules.
No Two-Year Home Country Physical Presence Requirement.
No 12-Month Bar.
F-2 children may attend full-time elementary or secondary school (kindergarten-12th grade).
F-2 spouses and children may enroll in other academic programs for less than a full course of study at an SEVP-approved school. (Check with the school and their international office to be sure enrollment is less than full-time.)
F-2 spouses and children may participate in studies that are ""avocational or recreational in nature""  (i.e., non-academic hobbies and recreational studies) up to and including full-time. 
New students may already be in the U.S. with another type of nonimmigrant status. Some of these classifications allow students to attend school and some do not. Students in F-2 and B1/B2 status are not allowed to study full-time at Berkeley and must speak to a Berkeley International Office adviser about changing status. See more information under Other Visa Classifications and Changing Nonimmigrant Status .
Contact an adviser at Berkeley International Office if you have any questions about your current or future immigration status. If you think you may need to change status, talk to a Berkeley International Office adviser before you complete the NIF.

"F-1 Visas for International Students: Requirements, Rules ...","Get ready to study abroad in America with our step-by-step guide to F-1 visa rules. 
Students wishing to study in the United States need to learn about the F-1 student visa application process. There are more than one million international students currently studying abroad in the USA, and with some preparation and guidance, you can join them. To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. The I-20 form provided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with your F-1 visa after graduation.
Have questions about the student visa process? Attend an upcoming Shorelight webinar > 
There are several F-1 visa rules to keep in mind if you plan to apply for a F-1 student visa. You must meet these requirements for your application to be accepted:
Institution certification—The college or the university where you plan to study needs to be approved by SEVP Immigration & Customs Enforcement.
Full-time enrollment—You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution while your academic term is in session.
English language proficiency—You must meet the required English language proficiency score of the institution you are attending or be enrolled in courses that will help you improve your English proficiency.
Sufficient funding—You must prove you have sufficient funds available to finance your studies and living expenses while in the US.
Valid passport—Your passport should be valid for US travel for at least six months after your program completion date.
Home country residency—You are required to have a residence in your home country to return to following the completion of your degree.

Before you begin your F-1 visa application, you must take the following steps:
Get accepted by a SEVP-certified institution before submitting your visa application. When you are accepted, you will receive your I-20 form, which you will need to apply for your F-1 visa.
Pay your SEVIS fee.
Complete your DS-160 visa application.
Schedule your visa interview.
Attend your visa interview.
If you are applying for a F-1 visa from India, Shorelight’s F-1 visa for Indian students guide is for you.
Once these steps are completed, you will be ready to complete and submit your F-1 student visa application. 
1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US government’s way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education. 
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay. 
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials. 
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., like getting a US driver’s license). 
Helpful resources: Confirm your US university is a SEVP-accredited institution 
Keep your Shorelight enrollment advisor updated through every step of the visa process – when you submit your application, schedule your visa interview, and, of course, when your visa application is approved.
2. Pay Your SEVIS Fee
The total cost for your F-1 student visa will be approximately $510, which includes the cost of the visa itself, plus SEVIS processing and maintenance fees. 
Requirements: Your I-20
Cost: $350 
Where to apply: Payment portal for your SEVIS fee
Make sure to save the I-901 SEVIS fee receipt. You will need it for your visa interview. 
3. Complete Your DS-160 Visa Application
Your DS-160 is your visa application. All prospective international students must complete a DS-160 to receive an F-1 visa. 
Requirements: Your I-20, passport, travel itinerary, photo for your visa
Cost: $160 
Where to apply: Application portal for your DS-160
After you successfully submit your DS-160, you will receive a printed confirmation with a barcode on it. Save this form – you will need it for your visa interview. 
4. Schedule Your Visa Interview
Find the nearest US embassy or consulate and schedule your visa interview. Wait times will vary by country and can take months — so remember to set up your appointments as early as possible!
If you are enrolling at a US university through Shorelight, ask your enrollment advisor about student visa interview tips or how to set up a mock interview session. Practicing your visa interview in advance will make you feel more comfortable with the process.
Ask your Shorelight advisor to set up a mock visa interview for you.
5. Attend Your Visa Interview
During the interview portion of the F-1 visa application process, the US consulate or embassy confirms you are coming to study as a legitimate, serious student. In your visa interview, you must also prove you have the funds to cover your time studying in the US, and confirm that you plan on returning home after your studies are complete. Attending your visa interview in person is required, though there are a few rare exceptions (e.g., if you are younger than 14 or older than 80 years of age, or if you meet certain visa renewal requirements). 
Cost: Your DS-160 payment covers the cost
Where to apply: Scheduling portal for your visa interview
After you successfully complete your visa interview, you will be granted your F-1 visa and acquire F-1 status. You are now cleared to study in the USA! 
Refer to Travel.state.gov to learn more. If you need any help with preparing or submitting your application, Shorelight provides application assistance for international students.
Before you attend your visa interview, make sure to have the following documents ready for evaluation by the consular officer:
A valid passport
A copy of the photo you will use for your visa
Printed copies of your DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmations
I-20 form
School transcript and official test scores cited on your university application
Diploma (if applicable)
Bank statements or other proof of finances
During your interview, the consular officer may request additional documents. To prepare, consider bringing the following documents:
Academic records such as transcripts, diplomas, degrees, or certificates from schools you attended
Standardized test scores required by your US institution
Evidence of your intent to depart the United States upon completion of your course of study
Statements proving your ability to pay all educational, living, and travel costs
As an international student, you might feel uncertain about your upcoming interview. While feeling nervous is normal, do not forget to take a deep breath and remember that you are well prepared! Your interview is important, but should not be stressful.
Your interviewer will ask questions to determine: 
Are you a legitimate student?
Do you have the resources to pay for your studies?
Do you plan to return home after completing your degree?
To prepare for your F-1 student visa interview, here are some questions you might be asked: 
Why did you pick this university?
Which other US universities did you apply to?
How will you pay for your education?
Do you have relatives in the USA?
Do you plan to work while in the USA?
What do you plan to do after graduation?
Your Shorelight advisor can help you prepare for your interview by giving you a detailed overview of what the process will involve. They can also help you practice with mock interviews! Shorelight’s F-1 student visa interview guide can also help you learn more about what you can do to prepare for your upcoming interview. 
There is a possibility that your F-1 visa application will be denied. If this happens, you will be given detailed reasoning in writing, including the section of the law that led to the denial of your application.  
To avoid having your F-1 student visa application denied, it is important to read and follow all instructions carefully. Always double- and triple-check your documents before submitting your application. Shorelight advisors can offer visa assistance to make this process easier for you: They are happy to help you organize all the documents you will need, in the correct formats, and on schedule. 
Remember: During your F-1 student visa interview, you want to sufficiently demonstrate that you are traveling to the US to study and planning to return to your home country once your program is complete. Keep this in mind as you answer your interview questions.
As an international student, you must actively maintain your F-1 status to continue studying in the US. To do this, you must comply with both university regulations and codes of conduct, as well as with the requirements and conditions set out in your F-1 visa requirements. 
When entering the US:
Make sure to enter the US no more than 30 days before your program begins.
As soon as you arrive in the country, contact your designated school official (DSO).
When you arrive at your university, contact your DSO again before the start date listed on your I-20 form.
While studying in the US:
Attend all your classes and maintain good academic standing. If you require support with any of your classes, your Shorelight advisor can direct you to academic resources to help you improve.
If you need extra time to complete your program which would exceed the end date specified in your I-20, speak with your DSO to discuss your options for possible extensions.
Make sure to enroll for a full course of study when your academic term is in session.
If you want to drop a class or change classes, make sure to speak to your DSO first.
If you want to take a break and/or go on vacation, remember to first complete at least one full academic year at your institution.  After your holiday, you must also register for classes in the next academic term.
Yes, you will be able to work in the US on a F-1 student visa. However, you will have to follow certain F-1 visa rules and restrictions:
You can only work part time on campus while your academic term is in session
You can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week
You may be able to work off campus with the approval of your university
During academic breaks, you will be permitted to work full time, if your university allows it. You can learn more about working as a F-1 international student by referring to USCIS.gov.
When searching for work while you study, make sure to seek approval from your DSO first. 
Keep in mind, once you finish your program, you will have a grace period of 60 days to leave the US. If you wish to extend your stay, you can speak to a Shorelight advisor to explore your options, such as transferring to another school or pursuing further education. You can also refer to Shorelight’s F-1 extension guide to have a look at your options.
Now that you know how US non-immigrant visas work for international students, create a checklist of next steps and get started. The sooner you begin fulfilling the USA study visa requirements, the better chance you will have of securing your spot at an American university.

F1 Student Visa - The Application Process and Interview Tips,"Register Now!






	An F1 visa is issued to international students who are attending an academic program or English Language Program at a US college or university. F1 students must maintain the minimum course load for full-time student status. They can remain in the US up to 60 days beyond the length of time it takes to complete their academic program, unless they have applied and been approved to stay and work for a period of time under the OPT Program.


	F1 students are expected to complete their studies by the expiration date on their I-20 form (Certificate of Eligibility for Non-immigrant Student Status) which is provided by the US college or university that the student has been accepted to and will attend.


		In order to qualify, applicants need to satisfy and prove several strict criteria during an F1 visa interview, including the following:
	

			Different universities have different admission policies. Your university will tell you what they need to determine if you are academically eligible. Among other requirements, you will need to show the school that you have enough money to support yourself while studying without having to work and you may have to show health insurance in order to cover any medical expenses should you need any medical assistance. Once the university has determined that your application is complete and you are academically eligible, they will issue an I-20 form to enable you to apply for your student visa.
		

			Applicants for student visas should generally apply at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate with jurisdiction over their place of permanent residence. This will normally be your home country — the country in which you live. Although visa applicants may apply at any U.S. consular office abroad, it may be more difficult to qualify for the visa outside the country of permanent residence.
		

Find a U.S. Embassy or Consulate


			The process of obtaining a visa can be difficult. If you’ve decided you need help from an immigration lawyer, explore working with a professional legal firm like F1 Visa Advisors, Inc. Founded by an experienced immigration lawyer in the US, F1 Visa Advisors offers a limited access program that provides students with personalized visa assistance and guidance to help increase their chance of getting approved an F1 visa.
		

	Always protect yourself by keeping a copy of everything that you fill out and send off.


		Although the process may vary or require additional steps, depending on your country and embassy or consulate, you will need the following when applying for your student visa:
	

Learn more about how to apply for your F1 Student Visa 

An F1 visa interview will be required to determine whether or not you are qualified to receive an F1 student visa. You should arrive at the interview with all of the required documents and receipts, and you should be prepared ahead of time to answer personal questions about your decision to study in the US. There are a number of common F1 Visa interview questions which we will look at below.


	If you've been denied your visa and would like to learn more about how to increase your chance of getting F1 visa approval, explore F1 Visa Advisors, Inc.

	If approved, you may be required to pay a visa issuance fee. Digital fingerprint scans will be taken for records. Your passport will be taken so that you can get your visa and you will be informed when you can get it back, either by pick-up or in the mail.


	Keep in mind that visa issuance is not guaranteed. Never make final travel plans until you have your visa approved. If your visa is denied, you will be given a reason based on the section of law which applies to your ineligibility. Filing a waiver of ineligibility is possible in some cases.


See more sample F1 Visa Interview Questions 

	If your F1 visa application is denied, it is based on US immigration law. If you are denied, the reason and section of law you are denied under will be given to you in your paperwork. Some applications are denied because the applicant failed to provide necessary information or supporting documentation as required. Sometimes, however, you can be found ineligible for other reasons.


	Of course, if you do not meet the F1 Visa Qualifications as stated above, you can expect to be found ineligible. For example, if you do not sufficiently demonstrate that the strong ties to your home country will influence you to return home after your stay in the US, you will be denied under INA section 214(b), Visa Qualifications and Immigrant Intent.


	Other common reasons for denial include Fraud or Misrepresentation, Unlawful Presence in the United States, Health-related grounds, Criminal-related grounds, or Security-related grounds. To learn more about visa denials and to see if you are eligible for a waiver or to reapply, the US Department of State website is a great resource.


	Denied your visa? If you need more information on the F1 visa process and tips on passing the F1 visa interview, see
	how F1 Visa Advisors, Inc can help. Learn more about F1 Visa Advisors, Inc.

	After you are approved for your F1 visa, you are able to enter the United States as an international student. However, after you arrive, you will need to stay aware of your obligations as an F1 visa holder. If you do not maintain your valid F1 visa status, you will not be allowed to return to re-enter the US if you leave and you will not be eligible for practical training (OPT or CPT) or on-campus employment. Here are some tips to assure you’re in good standing during your study abroad:


	Make sure you arrive in the US no more than 30 days prior to the first day of classes. Check in with your international advisor as soon as possible before your program begins.


	You must remain enrolled full time. Go to class and maintain passing grades. If you are having difficulty in your classes, notify your international advisor. If you are unable to complete your program by the date listed on your Form I-20, your international advisor can help you request a program extension.


	Your passport should be valid for at least 6-months in the future. Your country’s consulate or embassy can help you extend your passport if needed. Carry a copy of your passport with you along with your I-94 card for identification purposes.

Always notify your international advisor or office if you make changes to your address, study plans, or visa status.

	F1 visa students are not allowed to work off-campus. However, you may have some on-campus work or curricular practical training options if you qualify. Check with your international advisor to see if this is a possibility for you. If you choose to work without proper authorization, your visa will be revoked and you will be forced to leave the United States.


	You have 60 days upon completion of your program to leave the United States under your F1 visa. To remain in the US, you will need to re-enroll in a higher program, transfer to another school to receive a new I-20 form, or apply to change your visa status. Your international advisor can give you more information regarding your options.

F1 Visa Renewal - Step by Step Guide - Visa Guide,"In this article

Complete guide to renewing and extending an F1 visa
In this article
As a foreign national you can study in the US with an F-1 student visa. If your student visa expires before your program is over, you may be eligible for an F-1 visa renewal. To renew your F-1 student visa you have to re-apply for the visa from your home country, or another country, at a US embassy or consulate (applying from your country is always preferable).
You only need to renew your visa if you plan on leaving and returning to the US because if your student visa expires, but your Form 1-20 is still valid you can continue your studies. However, you never know when you might need to travel so it’s always good to renew your F-1 visa instead of staying with an expired one. Here you can read all the details about applying for a visa renewal, what other renewing options are available, and you can extend your F-1 visa.
To renew your F-1 visa, you have to follow the same steps you did when you initially applied for the visa:
After you apply for your F-1 visa renewal, you have to stay in the country from where you applied until your application is processed and you cannot travel to the US. If your application for renewal is denied, you have to return home.
Keep in mind that while you may apply for a renewal of your F-1 visa from another country other than your country of residence, it’s always advisable to apply from home since that will make the application process easier for you and the embassy/consulate.
You need to prepare the same documents that were required for your initial F-1 visa application and add some additional documents:
One other way you can renew your F-1 visa without having to apply again is through automatic visa renewal. Automatic renewal means that you can travel to Canada, Mexico, or other US territories for less than 30 days, and when you re-enter the US your visa is automatically renewed.
If you want to use this option, then make sure you plan your travel ahead of time before your visa expires or just after it has expired, and make sure you check whether you need a visa to enter Canada. Once you return, the border patrol officer will validate your status as a student and your F-1 visa is renewed for the remainder of your study program.
If your visa is about to expire while you are abroad, then you can renew your visa before it expires if you want to re-enter the country. Usually, you have to wait for your visa to expire and then renew it.
Your new F-1 visa is issued for another year. This is usually the maximum validity period that US embassies or consulates issue F-1 visas with, but if you need to stay longer to finish your program, you can apply for another renewal when your current visa expires.
Once your academic program and OPT are over, you have 60 days to leave the US and go back to your home country. During your application period, you had to submit proof that you plan to return home once you were done with the program.
However, there are a few ways through which you can try to stay in the US even if the F1 visa will no longer be valid and you will not be able to extend it. The only solution is to change your status.
The easiest route that most F1 visa students follow is to get an H-1B visa sponsorship. This changes your status to a nonimmigrant visa and you can stay and work in the US for up to 6 years.
The benefit of the H-1B visa though is that it is a dual intent visa. This means that after 6 years, you can also try to petition and get a Green Card. This will be an Employment-Based Green Card which will allow you to live and work in the US permanently.
If you could not get an employer to sponsor you for an H-1B visa, you can either return to your home country or try more complicated options.
One option is to self-petition for an Employment-Based Green Card. You can make your case that you have extraordinary abilities in the arts, science, business, or athletics and get an EB-1 visa. This is extremely difficult and most of these petitions fail because of extensive requirements.
The second option is to become a US investor. You can invest in a US commercial enterprise and create jobs. This could make a case that you are contributing to the economic development of the US and you might get an Investor Green Card or EB-5 visa.
The difficulty in getting this visa is that the requirement for the amount of the investment is too large. You must invest between $500K and $1 million in the commercial enterprise to qualify for an EB-5 visa. As a student who was on an F1 visa until that point, it is highly unlikely that you will have that amount of money saved.
The final route is to marry a US citizen. A lot of F1 visa students meet someone and start a relationship with that person which leads to marriage. Once engaged, the F1 visa student would qualify for a fiancé visa and after marriage, they get the IR-1 visa. The IR-1 visa is the spouse of a US citizen visa and it allows you to live and work in the US permanently.
This option is easier than the two previous ones, but you must be careful to not create a fake relationship. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) requires extensive proof of your relationship to the US citizen. They do this to prevent fake Green Card marriages.
You will have to know the person you are in a relationship with and prove that you have been together for some time. Additionally, once you are married, you need to provide proof that the marriage was legal. You will have to submit your marriage certificate, declarations from your ceremony witnesses, pictures of the wedding, and receipts from your wedding reception or honeymoon.
You can also extend your F-1 visa if you want to. The process for extension is a bit different than renewing your visa. To extend your visa, usually you have to complete a post-graduation OPT (Optional Practical Training).
An OPT is a work program you can do while on your student visa. You can do the program during your studies or after you finish your studies, but if you want to extend your visa, you should do the work program after your studies are over.
You can work for 12 months under a US employer, part-time or full-time. When your work is finished after 12 months, your employer can sponsor you for an H-1B visa and you can change your status.
Keep in mind that if you are a STEM student, you can extend your OPT for up to 24 months.

If your visa stamp has expired and you need to travel outside of the United States, you may need to renew your visa stamp in order to return.
It is important to remember there is a distinction made between your F-1 visa stamp and your F-1 visa status. F-1 students are admitted to the United States for the duration of their status, not for a specific amount of time. This is why an F-1 student's I-94 ""admit until"" date should read ""D/S.""
If an F-1 student is maintaining their status in the United States they do not need to renew their visa stamp to stay in the U.S. This means you may remain even after your visa stamp expiration date if you are maintaining your F-1 status. Find out more about maintaining your F-1 status on our website. If your visa stamp has expired and you travel outside of the U.S. you will need to renew your visa to re-enter the U.S. in F-1 status.
You may only renew your F-1 visa at a U.S. embassy or consular office outside of the United States. Contact the U.S. embassy/consulate, generally in your home country, to set up an appointment. The wait time for an appointment and for visa issuance varies. To see how long this process takes in your country, read the U.S. Department of State's visa wait time information.
It’s best to apply in your home country. If you are not sure which embassy/consulate you should contact, see this list of U.S. embassies.
When you arrive for your visa appointment, you will be required to show a number of documents, including:
Since you are applying for a nonimmigrant visa, you will need to prove to the consular officer that you do not intend to immigrate to the United States. In other words, you need to show him or her that you have definite plans to return home after college.
For more information and tips, please see NAFSA's Ten Points to Remember.
Generally, it can be more difficult to renew your F-1 visa stamp while on OPT. OIA would not recommend attempting to renew your F-1 visa stamp while on OPT if you are not currently employed. Please feel free to contact an advisor at the Office of International Affairs if you have questions.
Applying for visa in a country which is not your home country or the U.S., called a “third” country, can be more difficult than applying at home. You should have a valid reason for applying in the country where the consulate is located; you are likely to be denied if your only reason for applying in that country is to avoid your home country consulate. Examples of valid reasons could include to attend a conference, to visit family or friends, etc.
Additionally, you may need to prove that you have continuously maintained lawful non-immigrant status during your time in the U.S. or you may be sent to your home country to apply for the visa. Refusal in a third country is more likely than at home, so you should plan well in advance of your date of travel.
The U.S. Department of State provides specific guidance on applying for a visa in Canada or Mexico. If you intend to apply for a new U.S. visa in either country and are not a citizen or resident of either country, it is important for you to  contact an advisor at the Office of International Affairs if you have further questions.

If you plan to take a trip outside the United States (U.S.) or return to your home country for a temporary visit, you must confirm that you will have the proper visa documents to return to the U.S. If your visa stamp will be expired at the time of your reentry to the U.S., you must budget time while outside the U.S. to renew the visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in your country. You cannot renew a visa stamp inside the U.S. The process of renewing a visa is almost the same as applying for the initial visa because each visa application is considered an independent application.
It is not possible to apply for or renew non-immigrant visas inside the U.S. You must apply for a visa in a U.S. embassy or consulate outside the U.S. You may check the estimated visa processing time on the web site of the specific U.S. embassy or consulate where you plan to apply for your visa. Wait times may vary considerably among consular posts, and processing times indicated may not be accurate. Please see below for details.
In general, you will need the following in order to return to the U.S.:
*If you will need a travel signature, please note the following information regarding how to obtain a travel signature:
You should check your documents prior to making international travel plans. Note that it is also recommended that you take your visa documents for domestic travel outside the Boston metropolitan area. It is possible that a government official may request to see them even if you are staying within the U.S. when you travel.

Student Visa


Exchange Visitor Visa


Generally, a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

You must have a student visa to study in the United States. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa.

To enter the United States to attend:
You need the following visa category:
University or college

Private elementary school
Seminary
Conservatory
Another academic institution, including a language training program
Vocational or other recognized nonacademic institution, other than a language training program
M


Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.
Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.  You can also visit the DHS Study in the States school search page to search for SEVP-certified schools.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.
While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa.  However, once you depart the United States you must apply for a new visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.

If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

F-1 Visa Renewal | F-1 Student Status,"F-1 students (except citizens of Canada) are required to have valid, unexpired F-1 entry visas in order to enter the United States as F-1 students.
You are required to have a valid F-1 entry visa for the purpose of entering the U.S. in F-1 status. However, once you are in the U.S., the expiration of your F-1 visa has no bearing on your eligibility to stay. You may remain in the U.S. as long as you have a valid and unexpired I-20, an I-94 card marked 'F-1, D/S,' and are making full-time progress toward the degree objective indicated on your I-20.
Before leaving on a trip outside the U.S., check the expiration date of your visa and the number of entries you are allowed. If your visa has expired or will expire while you are abroad, you may need to renew it while you are abroad. Short trips (30 days or less) to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean (except Cuba) do not require an unexpired F-1 visa for re-entry into the U.S.
You cannot obtain a new visa while in the United States. Visas are issued only at U.S. consulates outside of the U.S. In order to obtain a new F-1 visa, you must carry with you: 
To confirm the requirements and procedure for applying for renewal of an F-1 visa, consult the embassy/consulate where you will be applying. Most consulates post current information on their website. Go to USEmbassy.gov for a list of consular websites worldwide. Additional information about F and J visas can be found on the Study & Exchange page of the U.S. Department of State website.
Please be sure to plan carefully. Visa appointments and application procedures vary from consulate to consulate, and waiting times vary depending on the time of year. We recommend that students renew their U.S. visa in their home country, but if you are planning to renew your visa in a third country, please see the section below.  
It is not always possible to renew your U.S. visa in a third country (i.e., a country that is not your country of citizenship or legal permanent residence). Some U.S. consulates do not accept visa applications from ""third country nationals"" at certain busy times of the year. (For example, the U.S. Embassy in Paris may not accept applications from non-French citizens during the summer.) If you choose to apply for a visa in a third country, make sure to check your eligibility by contacting the US Embassy or Consulate directly. 
Also, if you apply for a U.S. visa in Canada or Mexico and your application is denied, you will not be allowed to re-enter the U.S. If your visa is denied, you will need to return to your home country to renew your visa. Discuss plans to apply for a visa in a country other than your own with one of the International Student Advisors at the OISS.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security started charging a I-901 SEVIS fee in September 2004. Currently the fee is $350 for F-1 students. Students may or may not be required to pay the fee, depending on the following criteria:
Since individual situations may vary, contact the OISS at tcintl@tc.columbia.edu with specific information about your F-1 history so that we may help you determine whether or not you are subject to the I-901 SEVIS fee.

Renewing Your F-1 Visa,"Entry visas can only be issued outside of the United States.
We recommend that you apply for your new visa in your home country.
We also strongly encourage you to schedule an appointment in advance before you leave the U.S. and also double check the U.S. embassy website in your country to see if there are other documents
that they will require of you.
It depends on how much risk you want to assume in the visa renewal process. Many students

How to Renew and Extend the F | 1 Student Visa?,"Foreigners who want to study in the United States need an F-1 visa to achieve this objective. The F-1 visa holder can stay in the United States to attend the university/college. However, they can’t live in the country after their visa expires. The F-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa that doesn’t allow people to stay in the U.S. permanently. However, it might be possible to get a visa extension on genuine grounds. This article will describe the F-1 visa renewal process and tips to get an extension.
 
 
The U.S. Embassy in your home country will issue an F-1 visa for the duration of your academic program provided that you fulfill the F-1 visa requirements. If it is going to take you 2 years to complete your academic program, you’re likely to get the visa for 2 years. It’s also possible that you get the visa for one year and you have to renew it after one year. However, if something changes and you need to stay longer than the allowed time period, you can apply to renew your F-1 visa.
 
You can stay in the country with an expired visa provided that you have a valid Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status. However, it’s advisable to renew your visa rather than staying in the country with an expired visa. Here are two ways you can get a renewal:
 
 
Note: It’s not possible to get the F-1 visa renewal if your academic program has concluded and there is no valid reason why you should stay in the U.S. after your visa expires.
 
 
You can apply for F-1 visa renewal after you leave the United States. There is a process every applicant has to follow. It’s advisable to apply for the renewal from your home country as your chances of getting a visa renewal decrease when applying from other countries. If your F-1 visa renewal application has been rejected, you can’t enter the U.S. even if your academic program is still in progress.
 
You have to start the process by filing Form DS-160, Online Application for Nonimmigrant Visa. You will receive a confirmation page after completing and submitting the form. You might not need to schedule or attend the interview again for visa renewal.
 
However, you have to provide the documents supporting why you need a visa renewal. The documents you submit must be sufficient to establish that you truly deserve a visa renewal. Here are some of the documents that can strengthen your case and get you approval:
 
 
There is a waiting time after you submit the document for review. You will get a notification from the U.S. Embassy. If your request for renewal is approved, you can travel to or stay in the U.S. to complete your program.
 
 
Automatic visa revalidation is another way to renew your F-1 visa. It allows students to visit Mexico, Canada, or the U.S. territories for less than 30 days and get their F-1 visa automatically renewed upon their entry to the U.S. You can plan to visit these countries before or after your visa expires. If you need a visa to enter these countries, obtain it before your F-1 visa expires. You can stay in one of the mentioned countries for 30 days or return to the U.S. immediately.
 
You’ll get a visa revalidation after the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials examine your documents. The revalidation will allow you to stay in the U.S. for the period you’re enrolled in your academic program. You can read our article about Automatic Visa Revalidation to learn more about your options.
 
 
There are certain ways you can extend your F-1 visa beyond its validity. Optional Practical Training (OPT) is one of the opportunities you can get a visa extension beyond your academic program. OPT allows F-1 visa holders to work in the United States for a year. You can use this opportunity during or after your program ends.
 
You can work part-time or full-time for an employer in the U.S. Once your OPT is over, your employer might consider sponsoring you for an H-1B visa, or you can extend your OPT for another 12 months in some cases. For most F-1 holders, when their OPT is over and their visa expired, there is no way they can get an extension.
 
 
An F-1 visa holder has 60 days to leave the United States once your academic program is completed and OPT is over as well. Typically, it’s not possible to stay in the U.S. when the visa expires and you have to return home. However, there are some cases in which you can stay in the U.S. even if your F-1 visa has expired or you’re no longer able to extend it. Changing your status is the solution. Here are your options when it comes to changing your status:
 
 
Getting an H-1B visa sponsorship is probably an easy way for F-1 visa holders to change their status to a nonimmigrant visa and extend their stay in the United States for up to 6 years. H-1B is a dual intent visa, which means you can attempt to get a green card after 6 years. This is going to be an employment-based green card that will allow you to stay and work in the U.S. permanently. 
 
If any employer in the U.S. is not willing to sponsor you for an H-1B visa, you can consider returning to your home country or you may try other complicated ways to get a visa extension. Self-petition for an employment-based immigrant visa is also an option. A successful demonstration of your capabilities in science, arts, business, etc. can get you an EB-1 visa. However, it’s difficult to get success with these options due to a number of rigid requirements.
 
 
If you have the resources to invest in the U.S. economy, you might qualify to get an Investor Green Card or EB-5 visa which will allow you to stay in the U.S. permanently. To avail this option, you have to make a considerable contribution towards economic development in the U.S. The only issue with this option is the minimum requirement for the amount of investment. To qualify for an EB-5 visa, you have to invest between $500K and $1 million. Students usually don’t have this much money. However, if you have resources, you may consider this option.
 
 
Marrying a U.S. citizen might enable you to change your status. There are many cases where F-1 visa holders start a relationship with a U.S. citizen which often leads to marriage. If you’re planning to marry a U.S. citizen, it will make you eligible for the IR-1 visa which is for the spouse of a U.S. citizen. This option seems easier than the above-mentioned ways. However, getting an IR-1 visa involves complexities and extensive process. Since many people try to create a fake relationship to get a green card, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) requires solid proof of your relationship.
 
You can produce many supporting documents to ensure the USCIS that your relationship is not fake. Marriage certificates, pictures, declarations from ceremony witnesses, or anything that strengthens your relationship being genuine should be provided.

Renewing Your U.S. Visa | Travel Information for Students ...,"To enter the U.S., all international students, with the exception of those from Canada, must have a valid F-1/J-1 visa upon arrival at a U.S. port of entry.
If your visa has expired and you do need to travel outside of the U.S. and re-enter to continue your studies, you will need to re-new your visa. You can re-new your visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in your home country.  You are not able to obtain a new visa from within the U.S. 
Visa processing times vary from country to country.  We recommend that you contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate where you plan to apply to learn about the visa application process.
NOTE:  Please see temporary guidance on visa interview requirements through 12/21/2023.
We recommend that you present the following documents when you apply for an F-1/J-visa: 
Valid Passport (valid for at least 6 months into the future)
Your Form I-20/DS-2019 (with a valid travel signature)
Enrollment Verification Letter 
Evidence of Financial Support-You will need financial documents which provide proof of sufficient funds for at least one academic year as specified on your Form I-20 / DS-2019.  You can present various documents as evidence of financial support.
Scholarship/Financial Aid Letter- If you are receiving funding from Brandeis, you must have an up to date letter from Student Financial Services or your department which specifies the amount and conditions of your scholarship, fellowship, loan or financial assistance.
Bank Statements-If you are funded by personal or family funds, you must have a bank statement in your name or a bank statement with a letter from your financial sponsor/account holder.
F-1 visa applicants must demonstrate ""nonimmigrant intent.""  Be prepared to answer questions about your plans to return home following the completion of your degree.
If you travel outside of the U.S. during your OPT or STEM OPT period, after your F-1 visa has expired , you will need to renew your F-1 visa before returning to the U.S.  Remember, OPT/STEM OPT is an extension of your F-1 status.
We recommend that you present the following documents when you apply for an F-1 visa: 
We recommend checking the website of your local U.S. Embassy or Consulate to see if they have additional required documentation for visa renewal.
F-1 visa applicants must demonstrate ""nonimmigrant intent"", even while on OPT.  Be prepared to answer questions about your plans to return home following the completion of your practical training.
Applying for a visa in a country which is not your home country (called a ""third country"") can be more difficult than applying at home. It may take more time to apply for a visa in a third country, and there is a higher risk of denial. If your visa application is denied by a consular officer in a third country, you must return to your home to apply for a new visa before you can return to the U.S. in student status.
The ISSO recommends that international students seeking to renew their visas do so in their home countries if possible.
The Department of State (DOS) may delay the issuance of visas to some students due to the need for further time for additional review and/or security clearances.  This is called ""Administrative Processing"" and it takes place after the visa interview. The student should receive a 221(g) letter indicating that their visa application is subject to further administrative processing. 
The duration of the administrative processing will vary based on the individual circumstances of each case. Visa applicants are reminded to apply early for their visas, well in advance of the anticipated travel date.
It is impossible to know which applications will require additional processing. However, additional processing is more common among applicants:
If you suspect your application may require administrative processing, we recommend that you request a letter from your department to offer additional details about your program or work in the United States. This letter may include:
The letter should be written in English, with limited use of technical terminology or jargon. You may present this letter at the time of the visa interview, as needed. While  a letter will not prevent your application from being subject to security clearance, the letter may help to provide information and speed processing along. Once a security clearance is granted, it remains valid for up to four years for subsequent visa renewals.
While this may not prevent administrative processing, it could result in a quicker resolution of your case.

									Welcome to the International Student Hub — a place to learn about and connect with Northeastern's International community!								

																Depending on the length of your program and duration of your visa, your visa may expire during your program at Northeastern University. If your visa expires, you will need to renew it before you re-enter the U.S. after traveling abroad.									
The process of renewing your visa is similar to the initial visa process you completed before arrival. You must renew your visa while you are abroad. Please note that you are not able to renew your visa while in the U.S.
You will need to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in your home country. For more details about the visa application process, please review the F-1 and J-1 Visa Process pages.
If you travel to Canada, Mexico, or one of the islands adjacent to the U.S. (other than Cuba) for less than thirty days with your valid passport, a valid form I-20 or form DS-2019, and your most recent form I-94, you may be eligible to travel with an expired F or J visa. This process is known as automatic visa revalidation. However, you must meet certain conditions in order to be eligible for automatic visa revalidation. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for more information on eligibility.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.

Congratulations on your decision to study in the United States. Nonimmigrant students who come to the United States to study must follow specific rules. However, different rules apply depending on your student type and education level. Learn what student type and education level applies to you below:
Student Type:
Education Level:

Your first step is to apply to a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school in the United States. Use the School Search tool to find SEVP-certified schools and programs that are eligible to enroll F-1 and M-1 students. For more information about the types of programs that are available to you, please visit EducationUSA.
If you are a student currently enrolled in the equivalent of a kindergarten through grade 12 program, visit the Kindergarten to Grade 12 page on Study in the States.
The Form I-20
Once you are accepted into an SEVP-certified school, your school’s designated school official will send you a document called the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” The Form I-20 is a paper record of your information in our Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) database. Each school that accepts you will mail you a Form I-20.
For more information, visit the Students and the Form I-20 page.
After receiving your Form I-20, you must pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee.
Federal regulations require all F, M and J students pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee before applying for their U.S. student visa. You can pay your I-901 SEVIS Fee online at FMJfee.com or by using Western Union Quick Pay. You must present the receipt as proof of payment when you apply for visa. It’s important that the SEVIS ID number on your I-901 SEVIS Fee receipt matches your SEVIS ID number on your Form I-20. If it does not, or you encounter other issues paying your fee, please contact SEVP.
I-901 SEVIS Fee Assistance:
Learn more about the I-901 SEVIS Fee:
After paying the I-901 SEVIS Fee and getting a receipt, you must apply for a visa at any U.S. Embassy or Consulate before you come to the United States.
To receive a visa, you will have to participate in an in-person interview. During your visa interview, you will need to establish that you meet the requirements under U.S. law to receive the category of visa for which you are applying. The consular officer will determine if you qualify to receive a visa and which visa category is appropriate based on your purpose of travel.
A visa does not guarantee entrance to the United States; it only permits you to arrive and seek permission to enter the country. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the U.S. port of entry has the final authority to admit entry into the country.
The following pages will assist with this process:
Before you leave for the United States, familiarize yourself with the different documents you will need or could need when you arrive. It is also a good idea to make at least two sets of copies of these documents: one copy to leave with your family before you depart and one copy to give to your school officials. Required documents include your:
It is also smart to have your acceptance letter, proof of financial ability and any other supporting documentation with you, in case the Customs and Border Protection officer asks for them. You should carry your original travel documents on you at all times while traveling. Do not put them in your checked baggage. For more information on traveling to the United States, visit the Getting to the United States page.
When you arrive to the United States you will meet a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry, who will verify your information and determine if you may enter the country.
If the officer cannot initially verify your information, or if you do not have all of the required documentation, you may be directed to an interview area known as “secondary inspection.” Secondary inspection allows inspectors to conduct additional research in order to verify information without causing delays for other arriving passengers.
The inspector will first attempt to verify your status by using SEVIS. In the event that the CBP officer needs to verify information with your school or program, we strongly recommend that you have the name and telephone number of the designated school official (DSO) at your school on hand. If you arrive during non-business hours (evening, weekends, holidays), you should also have an emergency or non-business hour phone number available for this official.
Failure to comply with U.S. government entry-exit procedures may result in your being denied entry to the United States. Under certain circumstances, the CBP officer may issue a Form I-515A, “Notice to Student or Exchange Visitor,” which authorizes temporary admission into the United States. Work with your school without delay to submit the proper documentation required by the Form I-515A. Failing to comply with a Form I-515A will result in the termination of your status. Read SEVP’s Form I-515A Noncompliance Termination procedure to ensure you understand how to properly respond and maintain your status.
If the CBP officer admits you into the country, you will be given a Form I-94, “Arrival/Departure Record.” This form shows that you have been legally admitted into the United States, the class of admission and your authorized period of stay. It is very important that the information on the record is correct. Inconsistencies between the information on the Form I-94 and SEVIS records can reduce the chances of a successful systems interface and can result in denial of benefits or difficulty re-entering the country.
You have 30 days to enter the country before your official program start date, as listed on your Form I-20. If you do not report to your school by your program start date, your DSO may terminate your SEVIS record. We suggest that you contact your school immediately once you enter the country so that there is no question of your arrival.
If you cannot enter the United States for the term listed on your Form I-20, contact your school officials as soon as possible so that they can update your record so your plans are accurately reflected in SEVIS.
As an F or M student, you will often hear the phrase “maintaining status.” Maintaining your status means that you are fulfilling the purpose for why the U.S. Department of State issued you your visa and following the regulations associated with that purpose. Remember, a student visa is a travel document you receive from a U.S. consulate or embassy before you enter the United States. Your student status is what you must maintain after you are granted entrance into the United States. Learn more about the rules you must follow by talking to your DSO and reviewing the Maintaining Status page on Study in the States.
While studying in the United States, you may be eligible to apply for certain benefits. These student benefits are not granted by SEVP and require students to apply to other government agencies to receive them. The benefits you are eligible for will depend on your student status. Visit the following pages to learn more about potential student benefits:
As a note, most employment and training opportunities require authorization from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). For more information, visit the Employment page on ICE.gov.
If you are having an immediate problem and need assistance quickly, please speak with your DSO or responsible officer. If that person cannot help you, contact the SEVP Response Center at 1-703-603-3400 or at SEVP@ice.dhs.gov.
Once you have completed your program and fulfilled your purpose for coming to the United States, you may have a number of options. These include changing your status, applying for training, transferring to another SEVP-certified school or leaving the country.
Please note there are restrictions that apply to M-1 students regarding transferring and changing status. Talk to your DSO to understand what your options are.
If after your program is complete you do not qualify to stay in the country, or chose to depart, please be advised:
You can also visit USCIS to learn about naturalization and the path to U.S. citizenship.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.

"The F-1 Student Visa, Explained","Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
What is the F-1 visa?
The F-1 visa allows a student to temporarily live in the United States for a defined period of time while studying at a school, college, seminary, or conservatory.
Is the F-1 visa right for me?
For many students, the chance to study in the United States is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. Unless the person is already a U.S. citizen or green card holder, all prospective students will have to apply for a visa to study in the United States.
Because there are so many courses and places to study in the United States, the F-1 visa has a pretty broad application but also some very clear rules. The first is that you have to be coming to the United States with the intent to temporarily study. In other words, this is not an immigrant visa.
You must be studying at an academic institution, not training at a vocational school, as this will require an M-1 visa. Your academic institution must be approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning it needs to be accredited to be able to accept foreign students on F-1 visas.
You will be able to work, but because this is a non-immigrant visa, you will be restricted to where you can work and the type of work. Finally, although your spouse and children can come with you, they will not be able to work but your children can enroll in schools. They will be on F-2 visas and tied to your visa’s status.
Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have. Learn more about what we do to help.
The requirements for an F-1 visa are:
For many students, the process of applying and being accepted into a U.S. academic institution is the lengthiest part. The visa process is a series of steps that take place after you accept an enrollment offer. Not sure if you qualify for an F-1 student visa? Start by checking your eligibility.
Congratulations, you have been accepted into a course of study by a U.S. academic institution! Years of hard work probably led you to this milestone, so here’s the process to obtain your student visa.
After your SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be added to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVP uses SEVIS to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M, and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.
Once you have registered with SEVIS, you will need to pay the I-901 fee. This fee is currently $350 for most people, and funds the SEVP program.
Your SEVP-approved school will then issue you a Form I-20. This form is incredibly important as it confirms your acceptance at the school, and therefore your eligibility for the F-1 visa. Once this Form I-20 has been issued, you will be able to apply to a U.S. embassy or consulate for your F-1 visa.
The steps required will vary between different U.S. embassies or consulates, so make sure you check their websites for further information.
However, you must complete the Form DS-160, which is similar to the Form DS-260 for immigrant visas. The form is very detailed and can take some time to fill in, so make sure you set aside plenty of time to complete it.
Once you have completed the Form DS-160, you will need to schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, unless you are under 13 years of age or over 80 years of age. The U.S. Department of State says you should schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country where you live. You may schedule your interview at another U.S. embassy or consulate, but be aware that it may be more difficult to qualify for a visa outside of the country where you live.
Prior to your interview, you will need to pay the $185 application fee and also, depending on your nationality, pay an issuance fee, as well. The visa issuance fee is only due after your interview, if your visa is approved. The next step will be an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate.
Visa wait times can vary depending on the time of year and location. You can use the appointment wait time tool to see how long you will have to wait for an appointment at a specific U.S. embassy or consulate.
At this stage, it is important to note that F-1 visas for new students can only be issued up to 365 days (one year) in advance of the start date for a course of study. It used to be 120 days, but in February, 2023, the State Department extended the period.
Note: For existing F-1 visas, this is not the case and visas can be issued any time, as long as the student is currently enrolled at a SEVP-approved school or institution and in SEVIS.
Boundless not only makes it easy for you to complete your F-1 student visa application, but we can also help you get ready for your visa interview. Learn more about what you get with Boundless.
You will generally be required to attend an interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate. You will need to bring:
You should also be prepared to bring evidence of:
During your interview, the consular officer will ask you questions to determine whether or not to approve your F-1 visa. Make sure you are complete and accurate in your answers, as you will be under oath. For interview tips, see the Boundless guide on preparing for the F-1 student visa interview.
The consular officer will also take your fingerprints, although this will vary depending on your location. After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing. The consular officer will let you know if this is required.
Once your interview is complete, you will be informed of the outcome and, if successful, be issued a visa to study in the United States.

Yes, you can bring your spouse and children with you. Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
F-1 students cannot work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students can engage in three types of off-campus employment:
This depends on your individual taxation situation, but typically you might be required to file a U.S. tax return. For more information, seek advice from a qualified tax professional.
Generally, an F-1 student may transfer between SEVP-certified schools. However, this does involve paperwork and coordination. See here for more detailed instructions.
There are some programs and visas available for F-1 visa holders after you finish studying in the United States. These can be highly individual to your circumstances, field of study, and professional background, so do your research carefully.

You don’t have to navigate the F-1 student visa process alone. Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have along the way. Learn more about what we do to help.

How the United States Immigration System Works,"Download PDF with Citations
U.S. immigration law is based on the following principles: the reunification of families, admitting immigrants with skills that are valuable to the U.S. economy, protecting refugees, and promoting diversity. This fact sheet provides basic information about how the U.S. legal immigration system is designed and functions.
The body of law governing U.S. immigration policy is called the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The INA allows the United States to grant up to 675,000 permanent immigrant visas each year across various visa categories. On top of those 675,000 visas, the INA sets no limit on the annual admission of U.S. citizens’ spouses, parents, and children under the age of 21. In addition, each year the president is required to consult with Congress and set an annual number of refugees to be admitted to the United States through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.
Once a person obtains an immigrant visa and comes to the United States, they become a lawful permanent resident (LPR). In some circumstances, noncitizens already inside the United States can obtain LPR status through a process known as “adjustment of status.”
LPRs are eligible to apply for nearly all jobs (i.e., jobs not legitimately restricted to U.S. citizens) and can remain in the country permanently, even if they are unemployed. After residing in the United States for five years (or three years in some circumstances), LPRs are eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship. It is impossible to apply for citizenship through the normal process without first becoming an LPR.

Each year the United States also admits a variety of noncitizens on a temporary basis. Such “non-immigrant” visas are granted to everyone from tourists to foreign students to temporary workers permitted to remain in the country for years. While certain employment-based visas are subject to annual caps, other non-immigrant visas (including tourist and student visas) have no numerical limits.

Family unification is an important principle governing U.S. immigration policy. The family-based immigration system allows U.S. citizens and LPRs to bring certain family members to the United States. Family-based immigrants are admitted either as immediate relatives of U.S. citizens or through the family preference system.
An unlimited number of visas are available every year for the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. Prospective immigrants in this category must meet standard eligibility criteria, and petitioners must meet certain age and financial requirements. Immediate relatives are:
A limited number of visas are available every year under the family preference system. Prospective immigrants in the family preference system must meet standard eligibility criteria, and petitioners must meet certain age and financial requirements. The family preference system includes:
In order to balance the overall number of immigrants arriving based on family relationships, Congress established a complicated system for calculating the available number of family preference visas for any given year. The number is determined by starting with 480,000 (the maximum number in principle allocated for all family-based immigrants) and then subtracting the number of immediate relative visas issued during the previous year and the number of aliens “paroled” into the United States during the previous year. Any unused employment preference immigrant numbers from the preceding year are then added to this total to establish the number of visas that are available for allocation through the family preference system. However, by law, the number of family-based visas allocated through the preference system may not be lower than 226,000. The number of immediate relatives often exceeds 250,000 in a given year and triggers the 226,000 minimum for preference visas. As a result, the total number of family-based visas often exceeds 480,000. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, family-based immigrants comprised 68.8 percent of all new LPRs in the United States.
The family-based immigration system is summarized in Table 1.

In order to be admitted through the family-based immigration system, a U.S. citizen or LPR sponsor must petition for an individual relative, establish the legitimacy of the relationship, meet minimum income requirements, and sign an affidavit of support stating that the sponsor will be financially responsible for the family member(s) upon arrival in the United States or adjustment to LPR status within the United States. The individual relative also must meet certain eligibility requirements that include submitting to a medical exam and obtaining required vaccinations (including a COVID-19 vaccination), an analysis of any immigration or criminal history, as well as demonstrating that they will not become primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.
The spouses and children who accompany or follow the principal immigrant (the one sponsored by the U.S. citizen or LPR under the family-preference category) are referred to as derivative immigrants. Derivative immigrants also count toward the numerical caps for the categories in Table 1. That means that many of the visa slots allotted for members of these categories are often actually used by the spouses and children of the members. For example, in FY 2019, 61,031 people were admitted in the category “brothers and sisters” of U.S. citizens, but only 22,179 of them were actual brothers or sisters of U.S. citizens. The rest were spouses (14,956) and children (23,896) of the siblings of U.S. citizens.
The United States provides various ways for immigrants with valuable skills to come to the country on either a permanent or a temporary basis.
Temporary employment-based visa classifications permit employers to hire and petition for foreign nationals for specific jobs for limited periods. Most temporary workers must work for the employer that petitioned for them and have limited ability to change jobs. There are more than 20 types of visas for temporary nonimmigrant workers. These include L-1 visas for intracompany transfers; various P visas for athletes, entertainers, and skilled performers; R-1 visas for religious workers; various A visas for diplomatic employees; O-1 visas for workers of extraordinary ability; and various H visas for both highly skilled and lesser-skilled workers. The visa classifications vary in terms of their eligibility requirements, duration, whether they permit workers to bring dependents, and other factors. In most cases, these workers must leave the United States if their status expires or if their employment is terminated. It may be possible, depending on the type of job and the foreign national’s qualifications, for an employer to sponsor the worker for permanent employment. A foreign national does not have to be working for the employer in order to be sponsored. However, depending on the permanent immigration category sought and the foreign national’s current nonimmigrant category, he or she may be able to complete the steps to become an LPR while continuing to live and work in the United States.
The overall numerical limit for permanent employment-based immigrants is 140,000 per year. This number includes the immigrants plus their eligible spouses and minor unmarried children, meaning the actual number of employment-based immigrants is less than 140,000 each year. Any unused family preference immigrant numbers from the preceding year are added to this cap to establish the number of visas that are available for allocation through the employment-based system. The total number of available visas is then divided into five preference categories. For some categories, the sponsor must first test the U.S. labor market under terms and conditions established by the Department of Labor, and the Secretary of Labor must certify that the petitioner’s application meets certain requirements before the sponsor may file a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). For some categories, the sponsor’s first step is to file a petition with USCIS or the foreign national may self-petition. The final step is the foreign national’s application for an immigrant visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad or an application to adjust status to LPR if in lawful status in the United States. For consular processing, the immigrant visa application cannot be filed until after USCIS approves the immigrant petition. For adjustment of status, the time to file the application depends on whether a visa number is considered to be immediately available.
The employment-based immigration system is summarized in Table 2.

Source:  Ruth Ellen Wasem, U.S. Immigration Policy on Permanent Admissions, (Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service, March 13, 2012), 4, https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/RL32235.pdf.
In FY 2019, immigrants admitted through the employment preferences made up 13.5 percent of all new LPRs in the United States.
In addition to the numerical limits placed on the various immigration preference categories, the INA also places a limit on how many immigrants can come to the United States from any one country. Currently, no group of permanent immigrants (family-based and employment-based combined) from a single country can exceed seven percent of the total number of people immigrating to the United States in a single fiscal year. This is not a quota to ensure that certain nationalities make up seven percent of immigrants, but rather a limit that is set to prevent any immigrant group from dominating immigration flows to the United States.
Refugees are admitted to the United States based upon an inability to return to their home countries because of a “well-founded fear of persecution” due to their race, membership in a particular social group, political opinion, religion, or national origin. Refugees apply for admission from outside of the United States, generally from a “transition country” that is outside their home country. The admission of refugees turns on numerous factors, such as the degree of risk they face, membership in a group that is of special concern to the United States (designated yearly by the president and Congress), and whether or not they have family members in the United States.
Each year, the president, in consultation with Congress, determines the numerical ceiling for refugee admissions. The overall cap is broken down into limits for each region of the world. After September 11, 2001, the number of refugees admitted into the United States fell drastically. After the Bush administration put new security checks in place, annual refugee admissions returned to their previous levels and rose during the Obama administration. During the Trump administration, the refugee ceiling fell sharply, from 110,000 in FY 2017 to 45,000 in FY 2018 and 30,000 in FY 2019. For FY 2020, the ceiling was set at an all-time low of 18,000—although only 11,814 were actually admitted (the lowest number of admitted refugees since the system was created in 1980.) The FY 2021 ceiling was set at 15,000 by the Trump administration, but was subsequently raised to 62,500 by the Biden administration. However, as of August 31, 2021, only 7,637 refugees had been admitted with just one month remaining in the current fiscal year.
Of the 62,500 admissions determined by the president for FY 2021, the regional allocations are shown in Table 3 below. Given the slow pace of admissions, it is unlikely that any of these allocations will be met.

Asylum is available to persons already in the United States who are seeking protection based on the same five protected grounds upon which refugees rely. They may apply at a port of entry at the time they seek admission or within one year of arriving in the United States. There is no limit on the number of individuals who may be granted asylum each year, nor are there specific categories for determining who may seek asylum. In FY 2019, 46,508 individuals were granted asylum.
Refugees and asylees are eligible to become LPRs one year after admission to the United States as a refugee or one year after receiving asylum.
The Diversity Visa Program was created by the Immigration Act of 1990 as a dedicated channel for immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Each year, 55,000 visas are allocated randomly through a computer-generated lottery to nationals from countries that have sent fewer than 50,000 immigrants to the United States in the previous five years. Of the 55,000, up to 5,000 are made available for use under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act program, created in 1997 to provide relief to certain asylum seekers who applied for asylum before a specific date. This results in a reduction of the actual annual diversity visa limit to 50,000. The program was originally intended to favor immigration from Ireland (during the first three years of the program at least 40 percent of the visas were exclusively allocated to Irish immigrants). Diversity visas are now distributed on a regional basis and benefit Africans and Eastern Europeans in particular.
To be eligible for a diversity visa, potential applicants from qualifying countries must have a high-school education (or its equivalent) or have, within the past five years, a minimum of two years working in a profession requiring at least two years of training or experience. Spouses and minor unmarried children of the principal applicant may also enter as derivatives.
Immigration bans implemented by the Trump administration effectively shut down the Diversity Visa Program in 2020 and left roughly 43,000 of that year’s lottery winners without their visas. Those 2020 lottery winners who did not receive visas by the end of the fiscal year lost their chance to immigrate to the United States, prompting some of them to file lawsuits against the federal government in an effort to obtain their visas. Although the Biden administration subsequently lifted the immigration bans, the Diversity Visa Program has resumed at a very slow pace. By the end of June 2021, the State Department had issued only 3,094 diversity visas for FY 2021. Some FY 2021 lottery winners have filed lawsuits demanding that the State Department issue their visas before the end of the fiscal year.
Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is is granted to people who are in the United States but cannot return to their home country because of “natural disaster,” “extraordinary temporary conditions,” or “ongoing armed conflict.” TPS is granted to a country for six, twelve, or eighteen months and can be extended beyond that if unsafe conditions in the country persist. TPS does not necessarily lead to LPR status or confer any other immigration status.
Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) provides protection from deportation for individuals whose home countries are unstable, therefore making return dangerous. Unlike TPS, which is authorized by statute, DED is at the discretion of the executive branch. DED does not necessarily lead to LPR status or confer any other immigration status.
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a program established in 2012 which permits certain individuals who were brought to the United States while under the age of 16 and who have resided continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007, to remain in the United States and work lawfully for at least two years, so long as they have no significant criminal record and have graduated high school or college or received a degree equivalent. It does not confer any path to permanent legal status and requires renewal every two years. In 2017, the Trump administration attempted to end DACA, but this action was challenged in court. In June 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the administration’s attempt to terminate the program was unlawful. The Trump administration subsequently tried to impose new limits on DACA, but this action was also challenged in court and a federal judge in New York ordered the administration to set aside the newly imposed limits. Separately, a federal judge in Texas ruled that DACA was unlawful and that no new, first-time applications should be accepted. In January 2021, President Biden issued a memorandum reaffirming the federal government’s commitment to DACA and pledging to appeal the Texas ruling.
Humanitarian parole allows certain individuals to enter the United States, even though they may not meet the definition of a refugee and may not be eligible to immigrate through other channels. Parolees may be admitted temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.
In order to qualify for U.S. citizenship through naturalization, an individual must have had LPR status (a green card) for at least five years (or three years if he or she obtained the green card through a U.S.-citizen spouse or through the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA). There are other exceptions including, but not limited to, members of the U.S. military who serve in a time of war or declared hostilities. Applicants for U.S. citizenship must be at least 18 years old, demonstrate continuous residency, demonstrate “good moral character,” pass English and U.S. history and civics exams (with certain exceptions), and pay an application fee, among other requirements.

USCIS Issues New Guidance on F and M Student Visa ...,"Quick Hits
The updated policy guidance for F and M student classifications consolidates and clarifies existing policy into one cohesive document in an effort to provide clarity to international students and U.S. educational institutions. The guidance covers topics including the agency’s role in adjudicating applications for employment authorization, change of status, extension of stay, and reinstatement of status for students and their dependents in the United States.
In order to be eligible for F and M student classifications, students must intend to depart from the United States following their temporary periods of stay, typically following the end of the degree program and any period of practical training. Students must maintain a foreign residence that they do not intend to abandon. Notably, the policy guidance clarifies that F and M students may be the beneficiary of a permanent labor certification application or immigrant visa petition and still be able to demonstrate their intent to depart after a temporary period of stay. Having a pending or approved labor certification application or immigrant visa petition will not necessarily impact a student’s eligibility for these classifications. USCIS officers will consider all facts when determining if a student has demonstrated eligibility.
In the employment context, the guidance clarifies that an F-1 student seeking the two-year science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) optional practical training (OPT) extension may be employed by a start-up business provided that the start-up adheres to the regulatory requirements, including complying with training plan requirements and maintaining good standing with E-Verify. The guidance also clarifies that alternative compensation may be permitted during the STEM OPT extension as long as the F-1 student can demonstrate “they are a bona fide employee and that their compensation … is commensurate with the compensation provided to other similarly situated U.S. workers.”
Key Takeaways
The policy guidance offers new clarity for students and U.S. educational institutions with regard to the considerations made by officers when determining eligibility for F and M student classifications and when assessing options for employment.

International Student U.S. Visa Information,"
Jump to navigation


In the United States, there are three primary student visa types: F, J, and M. 
Visa Types
Valid student visas are required to apply to the Department of Homeland Security for admission into the United States at the port of entry. Students' Form I-20 document (F and M visas) or DS-2019 document (J visas), that are issued by their institution, is what allows them to maintain student status in the United States even if a visa expires during their studies. To issue I-20 or DS-2019 documentation for student visas, U.S. institutions must be certified by the Department of Homeland Security SEVP (Student and Exchange Visitor Program) (F, M visas) or designated by the Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (J visas), respectively. 
Although an institution certified by SEVP to issue I-20s (F, M visas), the institution may not hold national or regional accreditation. Recognition of course credits and degrees by other institutions and by U.S. and international employers is linked to an institution's accreditation. The U.S. Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation databases list all U.S. institutions' accreditation. Note that institutions designated by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to place participants in Academic Exchange programs (J visas) must be accredited.
Two separate U.S. government agencies manage international student arrival and status while studying in the United States. The U.S. Department of State is responsible for the initial visa application process and issuance. Once a visa holder arrives in the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then acts as the responsible agency for granting entry into the country, as well as enforcing immigration regulations that affect international students once they are in the United States.

Meet our experienced team of attorneys and legal analysts. As your immigration attorneys, we are your trusted counsel and fierce advocates.
With over 40 years of combined experience, FordMurray offers sophisticated legal solutions tailored to your business and your goals.
In today’s rapidly changing immigration climate, you need attorneys who are responsive, client-centered and who understand the speed of business.
 Nonimmigrant “student” visas are for individuals seeking to enter the United States to participate in an approved program of study. It is vastly important for institutions of higher education to be well-informed about the student visa regulations, their responsibilities to the students and to SEVP under those regulations, and their duties as an approved institution in order to stay in compliance with federal immigration rules. 
F-1 student visas are the most common type of visas for private elementary schools, secondary schools and higher education institutions. Administered through the American consulate of the student’s country of origin, the F-1 visa can only be used in scenarios where a student will obtain a degree, diploma, or certificate from a U.S. institution that has been certified through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Additionally, students must satisfy the following requirements:
Similar to the F-1 visa, the M-1 student visa provides a nonimmigrant visa to students enrolled in a post-secondary learning institution. Unlike the academic F-1 visa, M-1 student visa are for vocational schools. M-1 student visas carry the same requirements of the F-1 visa. Common uses for the M-1 visas include technical training and vocational certifications. FordMurray attorneys have counseled vocational schools of tai chi, holistic sciences, and circus training regarding SEVP certification and issues – if you think your organization might qualify, contact us for a free consultation.
While the most popular student visa is the F-1 visa, there are other options available to institutions who would like to sponsor a foreign national for training or education but are not affiliated with a SEVIS certified institution. We provide support for clients who need to bring trainees or interns to the United States on either a J-1 or H-3 visa.
An H-3 visa allows an employer to create a training program, with the caveat that the visa applicant cannot have the opportunity to obtain the same training in their home country. Under an H-3 visa, training may take place for up to 24 months. Upon completion of the 24 month training, an individual can return to their home country and apply for an additional 24 months training program. One clear handicap to the H-3 visa is participants may not participated in employment that is not directly related to the training. For that reason, H-3 visas are commonly used for companies who are hoping to open a branch of their company in another country and would like to conduct training in the United States.
Employers who use a J-1 visa must go through a pre-approved training program provider — taking the onus of creating the program from the employer. This also avoids the requirement that training be unavailable in the visa applicant’s home country. The J-1 is a shorter-term option, and allows you to stay only for 18 months. There are no options for extensions either, so once the time limit is up, the training must be complete, or, if they are a physician, apply for a Conrad Waiver. J-1 visa applicants must have a professional certificate or degree from an academic institution, in addition to a year of relevant work experience.
Common industries for J-1 training include:
If your business or organization is considering sponsoring students or trainees on H-3 or J-1 visas, it is important to have an experienced business immigration attorney on your team. Contact us today for a complimentary consultation to learn more about how we can help you.

If you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa. There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.
You may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:
The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.
The M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.
F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:
F-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.
For both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.
For more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.
In general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers  (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.

Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas
A student visa (F or M) is required to study in the United States. Foreign nationals may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational study (non-credit) as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program.
For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate
A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas.
Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is never permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that  requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States.
Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School
The first step is to apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States.  After the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee.  The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20.  After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa.  You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview.
If your spouse and/or children intend to live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee).
Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States.  A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.  
After you present your passport, visa, and Form I-20 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision.  Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.  
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors.  Learn about admissions and entry requirements, restrictions about bringing food, agricultural products, and other restricted/prohibited goods, and more by reviewing the CBP website.

Foreign students in the United States with F visas must depart the United States within 60 days after the program end date listed on Form I-20, including any authorized practical training.
Foreign students may request an extension through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website (see the USCIS Extend Your Stay page). Additional information to maintain student status is on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement SEVP website under Maintaining Your Immigration Status While a Student or Exchange Visitor.
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).  Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. 
Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more.

See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.

If you have a temporary break in your study, view the information on the SEVP website under Do Students Returning from Temporary Absences Need New Visas? If your student visa is still valid, but you are outside the United States, you should consult with your Designated School Officials. 
Spouse and children
Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 or M-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20, which is required to apply for their visas. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
Your minor children are permitted to attend school in the United States while accompanying you.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses.


A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States.


Students on F or M visas are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before the start date of their program.  If you wish to enter earlier than 30 days before your start date, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.  
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to student (For M) status prior to the start of your program.  You may not begin your course of study until the change of status is approved, and you may encounter lengthy processing times.  You may also depart the United States and re-enter on your student (F or M) visa. 
 
Students who are authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT) must have a Form I-20 endorsed for OPT, and apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). When authorized, OPT is temporary employment that is directly related to the eligible F-1 student's area of study. To learn more about OPT, please visit the USCIS Website and the ICE International Students webpage.
There are restrictions for student (F) visa holders to attend public school in the United States. See Foreign Students in Public Schools to learn more.
Whether you are applying for the first time or renewing your visa, you will use the same application process (please review How to Apply, above).
Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials, and waivers.
You may reapply if you believe you have additional evidence of your qualifications for a student (F or M) visa, or you believe your circumstances have changed. Review Visa Denials to learn more. 
Attempting to obtain a visa by the willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or fraud, may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States.
Review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws.
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not require visas to enter the United States as students, although they must present a valid Form I-20 at the time of admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.

"The F-1 Student Visa, Explained","Immigration help for you and your family
Immigration help for your business
What is the F-1 visa?
The F-1 visa allows a student to temporarily live in the United States for a defined period of time while studying at a school, college, seminary, or conservatory.
Is the F-1 visa right for me?
For many students, the chance to study in the United States is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. Unless the person is already a U.S. citizen or green card holder, all prospective students will have to apply for a visa to study in the United States.
Because there are so many courses and places to study in the United States, the F-1 visa has a pretty broad application but also some very clear rules. The first is that you have to be coming to the United States with the intent to temporarily study. In other words, this is not an immigrant visa.
You must be studying at an academic institution, not training at a vocational school, as this will require an M-1 visa. Your academic institution must be approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning it needs to be accredited to be able to accept foreign students on F-1 visas.
You will be able to work, but because this is a non-immigrant visa, you will be restricted to where you can work and the type of work. Finally, although your spouse and children can come with you, they will not be able to work but your children can enroll in schools. They will be on F-2 visas and tied to your visa’s status.
Boundless can complete your F-1 application, help you prepare for your visa interview, and answer any student visa questions you may have. Learn more about what we do to help.
The requirements for an F-1 visa are:
For many students, the process of applying and being accepted into a U.S. academic institution is the lengthiest part. The visa process is a series of steps that take place after you accept an enrollment offer. Not sure if you qualify for an F-1 student visa? Start by checking your eligibility.
Congratulations, you have been accepted into a course of study by a U.S. academic institution! Years of hard work probably led you to this milestone, so here’s the process to obtain your student visa.
After your SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be added to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVP uses SEVIS to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M, and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.
Once you have registered with SEVIS, you will need to pay the I-901 fee. This fee is currently $350 for most people, and funds the SEVP program.
Your SEVP-approved school will then issue you a Form I-20. This form is incredibly important as it confirms your acceptance at the school, and therefore your eligibility for the F-1 visa. Once this Form I-20 has been issued, you will be able to apply to a U.S. embassy or consulate for your F-1 visa.
The steps required will vary between different U.S. embassies or consulates, so make sure you check their websites for further information.
However, you must complete the Form DS-160, which is similar to the Form DS-260 for immigrant visas. The form is very detailed and can take some time to fill in, so make sure you set aside plenty of time to complete it.
Once you have completed the Form DS-160, you will need to schedule an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, unless you are under 13 years of age or over 80 years of age. The U.S. Department of State says you should schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country where you live. You may schedule your interview at another U.S. embassy or consulate, but be aware that it may be more difficult to qualify for a visa outside of the country where you live.
Prior to your interview, you will need to pay the $185 application fee and also, depending on your nationality, pay an issuance fee, as well. The visa issuance fee is only due after your interview, if your visa is approved. The next step will be an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate.
Visa wait times can vary depending on the time of year and location. You can use the appointment wait time tool to see how long you will have to wait for an appointment at a specific U.S. embassy or consulate.
At this stage, it is important to note that F-1 visas for new students can only be issued up to 365 days (one year) in advance of the start date for a course of study. It used to be 120 days, but in February, 2023, the State Department extended the period.
Note: For existing F-1 visas, this is not the case and visas can be issued any time, as long as the student is currently enrolled at a SEVP-approved school or institution and in SEVIS.
Boundless not only makes it easy for you to complete your F-1 student visa application, but we can also help you get ready for your visa interview. Learn more about what you get with Boundless.
You will generally be required to attend an interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate. You will need to bring:
You should also be prepared to bring evidence of:
During your interview, the consular officer will ask you questions to determine whether or not to approve your F-1 visa. Make sure you are complete and accurate in your answers, as you will be under oath. For interview tips, see the Boundless guide on preparing for the F-1 student visa interview.
The consular officer will also take your fingerprints, although this will vary depending on your location. After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing. The consular officer will let you know if this is required.
Once your interview is complete, you will be informed of the outcome and, if successful, be issued a visa to study in the United States.

Yes, you can bring your spouse and children with you. Your spouse and unmarried, minor children who intend to reside with you during your study may apply for F-2 visas. Although SEVIS fee payment is not required, your school must issue them an individual Form I-20. You must provide a copy of your F-1 or M-1 visa and provide proof of relationship.
F-1 students cannot work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students can engage in three types of off-campus employment:
This depends on your individual taxation situation, but typically you might be required to file a U.S. tax return. For more information, seek advice from a qualified tax professional.
Generally, an F-1 student may transfer between SEVP-certified schools. However, this does involve paperwork and coordination. See here for more detailed instructions.
There are some programs and visas available for F-1 visa holders after you finish studying in the United States. These can be highly individual to your circumstances, field of study, and professional background, so do your research carefully.

Apply For Your U.S. Student Visa: Undergraduate,"
Jump to navigation

The United States government offers three student visa types including F, J, and M.
Before you can apply for an F, J, or M student visa, you must first apply and be accepted by a U.S. institution of higher education that is certified by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP).
Even when an institution is SEVP-certified and able to issue I-20 and DS-2019 forms for use in visa applications, it may not hold national or regional accreditation. The U.S. Department of Education and Council for Higher Education Accreditation databases list accreditation status for all U.S. institutions. Institutions designated by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to place participants in Academic Exchange programs (J visas) must be accredited. Recognition of course credits and degrees by other institutions and by U.S. and international employers is linked to an institution's accreditation. To learn more about accreditation talk to an EducationUSA Adviser in person or online.
Once accepted at an SEVP-certified school, you will receive a Form I-20 or DS-2019 from the institution's international student office to present when you apply for your student visa. Once you receive your form, visit:
1. U.S. Department of State - Consular Affairs (Student Visas)
2. U.S. Department of State - U.S. Embassies and Consulates
3. U.S. Department of Homeland Security - Study in the States
It is important to note that two separate U.S. government agencies are involved with international student arrival and status while studying in the United States. The State Department is responsible for the visa application process and issuing the visa. Once a visa holder arrives in the United States, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then takes over as the responsible agency for entry into the country, as well as issuing and enforcing international student regulations. Please read information from all three sources above before applying for a U.S. student visa. The sites address employment, maintaining your status, and other vital topics.

"F-1 Visas for International Students: Requirements, Rules ...","Get ready to study abroad in America with our step-by-step guide to F-1 visa rules. 
Students wishing to study in the United States need to learn about the F-1 student visa application process. There are more than one million international students currently studying abroad in the USA, and with some preparation and guidance, you can join them. To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. The I-20 form provided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with your F-1 visa after graduation.
Have questions about the student visa process? Attend an upcoming Shorelight webinar > 
There are several F-1 visa rules to keep in mind if you plan to apply for a F-1 student visa. You must meet these requirements for your application to be accepted:
Institution certification—The college or the university where you plan to study needs to be approved by SEVP Immigration & Customs Enforcement.
Full-time enrollment—You must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution while your academic term is in session.
English language proficiency—You must meet the required English language proficiency score of the institution you are attending or be enrolled in courses that will help you improve your English proficiency.
Sufficient funding—You must prove you have sufficient funds available to finance your studies and living expenses while in the US.
Valid passport—Your passport should be valid for US travel for at least six months after your program completion date.
Home country residency—You are required to have a residence in your home country to return to following the completion of your degree.

Before you begin your F-1 visa application, you must take the following steps:
Get accepted by a SEVP-certified institution before submitting your visa application. When you are accepted, you will receive your I-20 form, which you will need to apply for your F-1 visa.
Pay your SEVIS fee.
Complete your DS-160 visa application.
Schedule your visa interview.
Attend your visa interview.
If you are applying for a F-1 visa from India, Shorelight’s F-1 visa for Indian students guide is for you.
Once these steps are completed, you will be ready to complete and submit your F-1 student visa application. 
1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US government’s way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education. 
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay. 
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials. 
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., like getting a US driver’s license). 
Helpful resources: Confirm your US university is a SEVP-accredited institution 
Keep your Shorelight enrollment advisor updated through every step of the visa process – when you submit your application, schedule your visa interview, and, of course, when your visa application is approved.
2. Pay Your SEVIS Fee
The total cost for your F-1 student visa will be approximately $510, which includes the cost of the visa itself, plus SEVIS processing and maintenance fees. 
Requirements: Your I-20
Cost: $350 
Where to apply: Payment portal for your SEVIS fee
Make sure to save the I-901 SEVIS fee receipt. You will need it for your visa interview. 
3. Complete Your DS-160 Visa Application
Your DS-160 is your visa application. All prospective international students must complete a DS-160 to receive an F-1 visa. 
Requirements: Your I-20, passport, travel itinerary, photo for your visa
Cost: $160 
Where to apply: Application portal for your DS-160
After you successfully submit your DS-160, you will receive a printed confirmation with a barcode on it. Save this form – you will need it for your visa interview. 
4. Schedule Your Visa Interview
Find the nearest US embassy or consulate and schedule your visa interview. Wait times will vary by country and can take months — so remember to set up your appointments as early as possible!
If you are enrolling at a US university through Shorelight, ask your enrollment advisor about student visa interview tips or how to set up a mock interview session. Practicing your visa interview in advance will make you feel more comfortable with the process.
Ask your Shorelight advisor to set up a mock visa interview for you.
5. Attend Your Visa Interview
During the interview portion of the F-1 visa application process, the US consulate or embassy confirms you are coming to study as a legitimate, serious student. In your visa interview, you must also prove you have the funds to cover your time studying in the US, and confirm that you plan on returning home after your studies are complete. Attending your visa interview in person is required, though there are a few rare exceptions (e.g., if you are younger than 14 or older than 80 years of age, or if you meet certain visa renewal requirements). 
Cost: Your DS-160 payment covers the cost
Where to apply: Scheduling portal for your visa interview
After you successfully complete your visa interview, you will be granted your F-1 visa and acquire F-1 status. You are now cleared to study in the USA! 
Refer to Travel.state.gov to learn more. If you need any help with preparing or submitting your application, Shorelight provides application assistance for international students.
Before you attend your visa interview, make sure to have the following documents ready for evaluation by the consular officer:
A valid passport
A copy of the photo you will use for your visa
Printed copies of your DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmations
I-20 form

As an international student, you might feel uncertain about your upcoming interview. While feeling nervous is normal, do not forget to take a deep breath and remember that you are well prepared! Your interview is important, but should not be stressful.
Your interviewer will ask questions to determine: 
Are you a legitimate student?
Do you have the resources to pay for your studies?
Do you plan to return home after completing your degree?
To prepare for your F-1 student visa interview, here are some questions you might be asked: 
Why did you pick this university?
Which other US universities did you apply to?
How will you pay for your education?
Do you have relatives in the USA?
Do you plan to work while in the USA?
What do you plan to do after graduation?
Your Shorelight advisor can help you prepare for your interview by giving you a detailed overview of what the process will involve. They can also help you practice with mock interviews! Shorelight’s F-1 student visa interview guide can also help you learn more about what you can do to prepare for your upcoming interview. 
There is a possibility that your F-1 visa application will be denied. If this happens, you will be given detailed reasoning in writing, including the section of the law that led to the denial of your application.  
To avoid having your F-1 student visa application denied, it is important to read and follow all instructions carefully. Always double- and triple-check your documents before submitting your application. Shorelight advisors can offer visa assistance to make this process easier for you: They are happy to help you organize all the documents you will need, in the correct formats, and on schedule. 
Remember: During your F-1 student visa interview, you want to sufficiently demonstrate that you are traveling to the US to study and planning to return to your home country once your program is complete. Keep this in mind as you answer your interview questions.
As an international student, you must actively maintain your F-1 status to continue studying in the US. To do this, you must comply with both university regulations and codes of conduct, as well as with the requirements and conditions set out in your F-1 visa requirements. 
When entering the US:
Make sure to enter the US no more than 30 days before your program begins.
As soon as you arrive in the country, contact your designated school official (DSO).
When you arrive at your university, contact your DSO again before the start date listed on your I-20 form.
While studying in the US:
Attend all your classes and maintain good academic standing. If you require support with any of your classes, your Shorelight advisor can direct you to academic resources to help you improve.
If you need extra time to complete your program which would exceed the end date specified in your I-20, speak with your DSO to discuss your options for possible extensions.
Make sure to enroll for a full course of study when your academic term is in session.
If you want to drop a class or change classes, make sure to speak to your DSO first.
If you want to take a break and/or go on vacation, remember to first complete at least one full academic year at your institution.  After your holiday, you must also register for classes in the next academic term.
Yes, you will be able to work in the US on a F-1 student visa. However, you will have to follow certain F-1 visa rules and restrictions:
You can only work part time on campus while your academic term is in session
You can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week
You may be able to work off campus with the approval of your university
During academic breaks, you will be permitted to work full time, if your university allows it. You can learn more about working as a F-1 international student by referring to USCIS.gov.
When searching for work while you study, make sure to seek approval from your DSO first. 
Keep in mind, once you finish your program, you will have a grace period of 60 days to leave the US. If you wish to extend your stay, you can speak to a Shorelight advisor to explore your options, such as transferring to another school or pursuing further education. You can also refer to Shorelight’s F-1 extension guide to have a look at your options.
Now that you know how US non-immigrant visas work for international students, create a checklist of next steps and get started. The sooner you begin fulfilling the USA study visa requirements, the better chance you will have of securing your spot at an American university.

Guidelines and Requirements of Student Visas Worldwide,"In this article

Complete guide to the worldwide student visas, the general requirements, the standard application process, and FAQs
In this article
With over a billion international students across the globe, student visas are now more in demand than ever. The idea of spending a semester or completing a study program abroad is highly appealing to young students everywhere. But, everyone who plans on becoming an international student must learn how to apply for a student visa.
A student visa is a document that allows you to pursue a study program in a foreign country. Student visas are usually issued for short-term purposes, and you must have already been accepted to a university or educational institution to qualify for the visa.
To make sure your student visa does not get canceled, you have to follow the student visa rules:
These are the student visas for some of the most popular student destinations:
See other countries that offer student visas below:
The application process for a student visa goes as follows:
To be eligible for a student visa, you must be enrolled in a valid study program in a foreign country. So before you can apply for the visa, you have to submit your application for the study program of your choice.
Once you’ve been accepted to a study program, you have to find a local embassy or consulate in your country and make an appointment for your visa interview. Please note that an embassy and a consulate are different units, and in cases where both are absent in your home country, you may be required to submit your application to a neighboring country’s visa office.
To submit your application, you must prepare the required documents. Make sure you make photocopies of any required documents, have them certified with an apostille stamp, and take your passport pictures. Also, check with the visa office to see which documents may require translation so you can get them ready.
You have to pay the visa application fee in time. Some visa offices may ask you to do that before you attend your visa appointment, while others may ask you to do it on the same day— make sure you double-check with the proper authorities.
Finally, all you have to do is attend the visa interview as scheduled. Make sure you don’t miss the date or the time, as it might be challenging for you to reschedule before your semester starts.
You will need the following documents for your student visa application:
A student visa lasts for the duration of your educational program. So, if you will be studying for two years in a foreign country, your visa will be issued for the same amount of time. Most study visas are issued anywhere between two to four years.
It takes several months to finish processing your student visa application. Some countries may finish faster than others, depending on how complete your application is and how many people have applied for student visas.
Student visa prices range anywhere between $160 and $600, including your service and administrative fees. The fee for a student visa changes based on which country you will study in; some countries may waive the visa fee for students altogether— you have to contact the embassy or consulate to find out the required fee.
Some countries may allow you to extend your student visa if you are behind on your study program. However, the visa extension policy is different in every country, so you need to check with the embassy and your education provider.
Yes, but you can usually only bring your partner/spouse and minor children. Please remember that your family members will also need to apply for their visas.
Your student visa can be denied for the following reasons:
You have to re-apply for your student visa. Before you submit another application, make sure you identify the reasons for your initial denial and address them. However, you should also keep in mind that you might miss the deadline to enter the country for your study program if your student visa is rejected.
In this case, there is a possibility that you might lose your spot in the program. At this point, you have to contact the admissions office and let them know that you are having issues with your student visa and see if they can give you an extension.

F1 Visa - US Student Visa Requirements and Application ...,"In this article
In this article
US student visa requirements, eligibility criteria, the application steps and FAQs
In this article
The F1 visa is a student visa that is given to international students who want to attend educational institutions in the United States. It covers levels from elementary school to university and graduate school, including other degrees.
To qualify to even apply for an F1 visa you must meet some specific conditions, such as:
Here are the documents required to apply for an F1 Visa:
To application process for the F1 visa goes through the following steps:
After you apply and are accepted into the school you want to attend, they will have to complete some procedures so that you can apply for the F1 visa. The most important document you need to have is Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status. Without this form, you will not be able to apply for an F1 student visa and attend your interview.
After you get your Form I-20, you can start the usual application process. This includes filing the DS-160 form online with the necessary information about your visa status.
The application fee for the student visa is $185. You must pay this fee and get the receipt, which you will need later for your interview documents. You might have to pay additional fees based on your country of origin and the US Embassy you are applying from.
When you are admitted by the SEVP institution, your school immediately registers you in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). To have full registration, there is a SEVIS I-901 fee. For the F1 visa, this fee is $200.
After filing the DS-160 form and paying the fees, you will need to schedule your interview. The interview is a mandatory step before you get your student visa. Try to schedule it as early as possible, since there might be delays due to the heavy workload of the US Embassy. When you schedule it, you will receive an interview appointment letter which you will need later on in the application process.
Before you go to attend your interview, you should prepare your file with the required documents for students.
When you go to attend the student visa interview, the questions will mostly revolve around your reasons for going to the US and the institution you are going to. The interviewer will try to assess whether you intend to return to your home country after you complete your degree.
When your visa is approved, it might be for the full time that you will be in school in the US, or for less. If your study program takes 1 year to graduate, the Embassy will most likely give you a visa that is valid for 1 year If your degree program is 2 years and you only get the visa for 1 year, you should then later apply to renew it. In this case, it is the best option to renew the F1 visa.
The validity of your F1 visa is for as long as it is stated on your I-20 form and I-94 form which is given to you when you enter the US.
If you are renewing your visa you should follow the same procedure. You might be able to waive the interview on the reason that you have already done it once and your intent is to continue your education for the remaining years to get your degree.
If your visa is approved, you are allowed to depart for the US 30 days before your program begins. You cannot enter the US any earlier than that.
In most cases, you will get the response on this visa immediately after the interview. At the end of the visa interview, the interviewer might congratulate you for getting the visa or will provide you with a document letting you know the reason for denial. This is because the processing of this type of visa actually happens before your interview. The interview is the last step for the US Embassy to assess whether they should issue the visa.
There are, however, cases where the response and processing of the F1 visa takes a few days, so you should be patient if that happens.
After you are admitted into the institution of your choice, you can apply for the visa 120 days before you are scheduled to start your program. You cannot apply any earlier, but applying later might cause you a delay due to processing times. So as soon as the 120-day countdown begins, make sure you submit your application.
After your visa expires, you have a 60 day grace period to prepare for your departure to your home country. If your visa doesn’t cover the whole time that you will be in school in the US, you will have to apply for renewal or extensions. The extensions are approved only if you can prove you will be completing your degree in the US and you intend to return as soon as it is over.
You may work as an F1 student but only for short periods of time since your visa is a student and not a work visa. You are allowed to work part-time on campus while school is in session and full time during breaks. If you want to work outside of campus, you have two options.
If you, for example, find a job that requires a different type of visa, other than F1, then you are also eligible to change status. You just need to work through the instructions of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and your employer or another petitioner.
Even though you have proved that you have strong ties to your home country, if you want to apply for a Green Card, you are allowed to do so on an F1 visa. It is a complicated procedure, though. You must either self-petition as a person with extraordinary abilities, get married in the US or prove that you will invest $500,000 in the US economy.
If these are not feasible for you, but you still want to remain in the US, the easiest way is to change status into a different type of visa such as an H-1B visa and have your employer sponsor you.
F1 visa students quite often have to travel abroad. They travel during university breaks or in case of emergencies. The travel can be to their own home countries or to other countries.
If you are an F1 visa student who wants to travel abroad, before you plan and book their travel you must follow some instructions. The instructions are to ensure that they can enter the United States again.
In case you have dependents, such as a spouse or unmarried children under 21 years old, they are allowed to come to the US too. This can be done with an F2 visa.
The F2 visa has no cap and dependents should just fulfill the requirements and complete the application procedures to get the visa. To be eligible for an F-2 visa, you must fulfill the following criteria:

	Anyone who will be studying in the United States could be issued one of the three following visa types for
	international students: F1 Visa, J1 Visa or M1 Visa. You may
	be asking, “What visa do you need to work as an international student in the US?”. The F1 and J1 Visas allow for
	the possibility of employment but does not guarantee it. The M1 Visa, however, does not allow for the possibility
	of employment. We’ve broken down each of these three types of international student visas so that you can get

			As you begin to think about funding sources			for your educational and living expenses in the United States, remember that you cannot count on
				working in the United States unless you have been granted a teaching or research assistantship.
			Immigration regulations are very strict with respect to working while carrying a student visa, and when you
			submit evidence of your financial resources, you cannot rely on potential income. The income on which you
			base your application must be assured, and it must be equal to or exceed the costs of the first year of your
			studies.
		

			Careful long-term and short-term planning is necessary to ensure that you will have a rewarding educational
			experience in the United States. If you are realistic about your financial needs, you will be better able to
			enjoy the exciting academic and cultural experience of living and learning in the United States.
		
Be sure to start exploring your funding options and establish your budget well before you plan to
					start your studies abroad!

					The International Student scholarships database contains frequently updated information about
					scholarships, grants and assistantships. If you are considering a research or teaching
					assistantship, please search the available options.
				

	When putting together your application for a student visa, you will first need to research the admission policy for
	your university. Keep the following items in mind:

Every school has different academic eligibility criteria. Your school will tell you what their requirements
			are. If you are still in the process of researching different schools, you can use the USA School Search to research general academic standing and test
			scores.
		
You will need to show that you can support yourself without having to work.
You may have to show proof of health insurance in order to
			cover any medical expenses should
			you need any medical assistance.
		
Although visa applicants may apply at any U.S.
	consular office abroad, it may be more difficult to qualify for the visa outside the country of permanent residence.

	For detailed application information and help preparing for your visa interview, please visit the
	F1 Visa Application process	section.


	You need to be aware that even if your visa is granted, it does not guarantee your entry into the United States. It
	is ultimately up to the CBP [Customs and Border Protection] to let
	you into the United States. It is also the job of the CBP to determine how long you may remain in the United States.


	At the port of entry, a CBP official validates Form I-94, Record of Arrival-Departure, which notes the length of
	stay permitted. This will be a small white card issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection upon your entry to the
	U.S. The form I-94 is your permit to stay in the U.S.


	Per US immigration law, students with F visas must leave the US within 60 days after the program end date that is
	listed on Form I-20. Students with J and M visa status must leave the US within 30 days after the program end date
	that is listed on Form I-20. However, if you wish to extend your stay in the US, you may request a visa extension
	through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website. Before requesting a visa extension, we
	recommend exploring your
	visa options after graduation.


	While living in the US, your plans may change and you might have to change your visa status. If you wish to do
	this at any time while living in the US, you do not have to apply for a new visa. You must request to change your
	nonimmigrant status through USCIS. We recommend that you notify your Designated School Official (DSO) about your
	desire to change as it’s important that your school is aware of any changes to your nonimmigrant status, and your
	DSO can help you through the process.


	After determining your student visa situation, you should carefully examine the healthcare options available to you
	while studying in the USA.

Student visa for the USA - The American Dream,"
Studying in the United States is a perfect career stepping stone. Therefore, the USA is one of the most popular study countries globally. Learn which visa categories are available for students in America and get important tips on how to apply.
Take the chance of living in the USA and apply for the official US Green Card Lottery!
For studies in the United States leading to a university degree, you will need a student visa. Visas for students belong to the category of non-immigrant visas and are subject to certain conditions.
Furthermore, internships and comparable programs are also considered in the student visa categories:
American schools and universities must have a SEVP certificate in order for you to enroll as a foreign student. Thus, you can only get an F-1 or M-1 visa for certified schools. This does not apply to J-1 exchange programs.
Short leisure study programs of up to 18 hours per week that do not count toward your university degree can be completed visa-free with an ESTA or B-visa.
Studying at a US university opens many career doors.
Suppose you are thinking about studying abroad in the USA. In that case, it is best to refer to the current educational institutions listed with the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS regularly provides an up-to-date PDF of certified schools and universities and an overview of the application process.
If you do not have a Green Card, the most important requirement for studying in the USA is being able to reimburse publicly subsidized costs from universities or educational institutions.
To apply for an F-1, J-1, or M-1 visa, you must also present the following proof or documents:
If you want to avoid high tuition fees in the USA, participate in the Green Card Lottery. Having a Green Card exempts you from the extra high fees foreigners pay for studying in the USA.
Most study programs offered by colleges, universities, conservatories, high schools, or language schools in the United States require you to apply for an F-1 visa.
In the case of language courses, this also depends on the intensity of the study: if a course is over 18 hours per week, an F-1 visa is required. With an F-1 visa, you may:
In exceptional cases, you may apply for a work permit to earn money during your studies in the USA.
F-1 visas are usually issued for five years. However, your residence permit is firmly linked to the duration of your studies or language course, which is noted in the I-20 form. If your studies end, so does your residence permit.
If delays such as illness or a change of subject mean that you will not be able to complete your studies in the specified period, you may be eligible to apply for an extension of your F-1 visa.
The cost of an F-1 visa to study in the USA consists of consular fees and the so-called SEVIS fee.
The J-1 category covers exchange programs administered by the U.S. Department of State. The purpose of the J-1 visa is to promote educational and cultural exchanges between the United States and other nations. There is no requirement to be a student to apply for a J-1 visa. Instead, with a J-1 visa, you may:
Depending on the program, the J-1 visa is valid for an average of between 12 and 24 months. Your residence permit is linked to the duration of your internship, employment, or exchange.
If delays mean that you will not be able to complete your internship, school year, or job in the specified time period, you may apply for an extension of your J-1 visa.
The cost of a J-1 visa for internships, au pair jobs, high school years, summer jobs, or traineeships includes consular fees and the SEVIS fee, which varies in amount depending on the purpose:
The M-1 visa allows you to receive education or training at a non-academic educational institution or facility such as a flight school, cosmetology school, or culinary school.
With an M-1 visa, you may:
Language schools are excluded from the M-1 category (you would need an F-1 visa for this).
Professional training is covered by US student visa categories.
The M-1 visa is valid for a maximum of 12 months or until the end of your education or training.
Suppose delays beyond your control prevent you from completing your education or training in the United States within the specified time. In that case, you may be eligible to apply for an extension of your M-1 visa.
The cost of an M-1 visa to train in the USA includes consular fees and the SEVIS fee.
SEVIS stands for ""Student and Exchange Visitor Information System"" and refers to a database that allows the US government to keep track of all student visas issued.
Before you can apply for a student visa, you must pay this fee - otherwise, you will not get a visa.
Depending on whether you choose a US government-sponsored exchange program (J-1) or privately organized studies (F-1 or M-1), the application process will slightly differ:
In the visa interview at your local US embassy or consulate, you must confirm and prove the information you provided in the ""Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application"" (Form DS-160).
Therefore, you will need to present all original documents you received during the visa process or essential to prove the information you provided. These include:
The embassy or consulate staff member will inform you whether your visa is approved at the end of your interview. Once approved, you can start making arrangements to move to the USA.
The path to studying or an internship in the USA always involves the DS-160 application form.
The wait times for visa interview appointments vary depending on your place of residence and visa category. Check up-to-date times at your local embassy or consulate on the U.S. Department of State's visa appointment wait times page.
A new student visa will be issued no more than 120 days before the start date of a degree program. If you are already in the middle of your studies and need to apply for a visa extension, you may do so at any time as long as you are properly listed as a United States student visa holder in SEVIS.
It is recommended that you submit your visa application as soon as you receive your I-20 or DS-2019 form, respectively, from your educational institution or sponsor.
With a new student visa, you may enter the United States no earlier than 30 days before your studies begin. Remember to carry your original I-20 or DS-209 form in addition to the usual entry documents.
If the purpose of your student visa (i.e., your studies, internship, advanced training, or summer job) ends, you must be out of the country within 60 days.
Under certain conditions, you can make a so-called ""change of status"" if the reason for your stay in the USA changes spontaneously. This allows you to change from a normal visitor to an officially recognized US student.
To change your residency status, you must:
Before applying for a change of status, check with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for the documentation required in your personal case.
Applying for a Green Card is possible as an F-1, M-1, or J-1 student visa holder under certain conditions. Potential ""entry routes"" to become a Permanent Resident (Green Card holder) are:
Of all the ways to go from studying abroad in the United States to becoming a legal resident with Permanent Residency and a work permit, entering the Green Card Lottery is the easiest. The odds of you becoming one of the 55,000 annual Green Card winners are excellent.
If you are entering the United States on an F-1, M-1, or J-1 visa, your spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 may join you using F-2, M-2, or J-2 and remain in the United States for the duration of your studies.
To make this possible, you must register your family members with SEVIS as well (SEVIS Dependent Form), complete the DS-160 form for each individual, and provide proof of your relationship.
Incomplete documents, inadequate financial resources, or errors in forms can lead to the rejection of your United States student visa. Also, sometimes the personal impression of the consulate staff or a so-called ""background check"" plays a role.
If you know the reasons for your rejection, you can reapply (you are allowed to apply three times within one year).
However, if you are unsure of the exact reasons, seek advice from your local US consulate or the team of experts at The American Dream's US Visa Service.
